# Escalation Guide

So you've noticed a problem with the site, or need to make a change that isn't to the `traditions/*.md` artifact files. (For making changes to `traditions/*.md`, see the [Editing Guide](Editing.md).

The best solution for this is to email Braden. See below for the sort of information to include.

## Bugs

If you've spotted something that doesn't seem to be working like it should, here's how to give a useful bug report.

- State what page this was on: viewing any artifact, viewing a specific artifact, the list of traditions, search, etc.
- Describe what you **expected** to see, like "The artifact description should fit neatly in its column".
- Describe what you **actually** saw, that you weren't expecting, "The really long Hindi word sticks out of the column".
- Mention what browser you're using, on which platform. For Internet Exploer, give the version. (You can check that in Help->About.) "Chrome", "Internet Explorer 9", "Firefox".
    - The site is known to work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE 9 and later. It might work in IE 7 or 8, but those should have been automatically updated to 9 or 10 now.
    - The site is known *not* to work in ancient IE 6.

As an example, "search is broken" doesn't help. What did you search for, what did you click if anything? Did you go to the wrong page when you clicked? Was the search results' layout broken? Be specific, and it will be much easier and faster to fix.

### Example

"I typed in 'bh' to the search box, and the entry for 'Bhagavadgita' has too long a name, and doesn't fit in the box. (Firefox)"
