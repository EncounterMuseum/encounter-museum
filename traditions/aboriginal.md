title: Bison Horn Mask
images: ["abo.hornmask.jpg"]
date: Unknown
origin: Alberta, Canada
size: 7.5 inches / 19 cm wide X 5.5 inches / 14 cm high
---
Ceremonial masks are a significant element in Native American / First Nations ritual. Great Lakes tribes often carved elaborate false face masks from tree trunks. Because large trees are not plentiful in the prairies, plains Indians fashioned masks from other available materials including bison (buffalo) horns. Horns were boiled until soft, split open, rolled flat, carved with eyes, nose, and mouth holes, then allowed to dry and harden.

title: Bullroarer
images: ["abo.bullroarer.jpg"]
origin: Australia
size: 15 inches / 13 cm propeller - 94 inches / 241 cm including the leather cord and handle
---
The bullroarer is an ancient ritual musical instrument dating to the Paleolithic period, 17,000 BCE. In ancient Greece it was a sacred instrument used in the mystery religions. In Australia, bullroarers accompanied didgeridoos in initiation ceremonies and burial rites to ward off evil spirits. Almost all Native tribes in North America used bullroarers in religious and healing ceremonies. Bullroarers were considered men's secret business by some cultures which women, children, non-initiated men and outsiders were forbidden to hear. Held by the handle and swung around the head, the spinning propeller’s deep humming sound represents the voice of the Sacred or of ancestors and announces the beginning of ceremonies.

title: Eshu
images: ["abo.eshu.jpg","abo.eshu2.jpg"]
origin: Nigeria, Africa
size: 12 inches / 30 cm high
---
Eshu is a trickster god of the Yoruba culture of Nigeria, West Africa. He is often found at crossroads and at times of decision making. Eshu is often shown wearing a large hat. His role is to upset the equilibrium when individuals or societies become too staid, unadventurous, set in their ways or take things for granted. Legends about Eshu sometimes have him saying the phrase: “Spreading strife is my greatest joy.”

origin: Iatmul Tribe, New Guinea
date: ca. late 1800s to early 1900s
size: 8inches / 20 cm
---
A koteka or phallocrypt is a gourd penis sheath traditionally worn by natives of some mainly highland ethnic tribes in New Guinea as a type of clothing. The style of koteka is characteristic of a given cultural group. Less elaborate sheaths are worn as everyday attire. More elaborate ones are for ceremonial and ritual use. This koteka is decorated with feathers and a totem face made from woven fibres.

origin: Tennessee, USA
size: Small stone - 3.5 inches / 9 cm X 1.5 inches 4 cm. Large stone - 3.75 inches / 9.5 cm x 3 inches / 8 cm
---
Displayed is a grey stone gorget (ornament or decoration) worn on a leather cord around the neck by Native Americans as a type of decoration or breastplate. During the 1800s these adornments were referred to as “peep stones” or “seer stones” by some non-Natives who claimed revelations were received by looking (peeping) through the holes in the stone. A "peep stone" similar to this is featured in Latter-day Saint history as a tool used by Joseph Smith, Jr. to translate the Book of Mormon and receive revelations.

date: Pre-Christian Tahiti
origin: Tahiti, French Polynesia
size: Small stone - 2 inches / 5 cm. Large stone - 4.5 inches / 11 cm X 2.5 inches / 6.5 cm
---
A marae is a sacred place serving both religious and social purposes in ancient Polynesian societies. Most marae were destroyed or abandoned with the arrival of Christianity in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Stones such as this one used to construct the marae are still considered powerfully sacred and said to contain "mana" or spiritual energy of the cosmic, impersonal force of the universe.

title: Pachamama
images: ["abo.pachamama.jpg","abo.pachamama2.jpg","abo.pachamama3.jpg","abo.pachamama4.jpg"]
origin: Peru
size: 5 inches / 13 cm
---
Pachamama (also Pachi Mama, Patchi-Mama) “World Mother” is a goddess of the indigenous people of the Andes. Incan mythology honours her as the goddess of fertility, planting, the growing season, and the harvest. The version of Pachamama displayed here is three-faced, reminiscent of the Triple Goddess (Maiden, Mother, Crone) of Neo-Paganism. Pachamama is the Quechan or Inca word for “Mother Earth” or literally “Our Mother in Space and Time.” Most cultures have an Earth Mother concept, and those of South America are no exception. But the word “Pachamama” goes beyond the name of a single goddess. It encompasses an entire world view and way of life. It involves the belief that the Earth is a living entity and the Mother of all Earth's life. In traditional societies, grown children were expected to take care of their parents, and, thus, it is expected that we all care for Pachamama as our Great Mother. Pachamama cares for her children as a mother cares for her young and does not turn away from them. If she fails to provide, it is because she is ill or has not be treated well. In the modern, blended Christian and Native traditions of South America, Pachamama is often associated with the Virgin Mary and the median between the opposites of Heaven and Hell, God and Satan, or good and evil. Unfortunately, Christian groups are working to remove Pachamama altogether. Images of Pachamama often have three heads, a turtle on her front, a frog on her back, and a snake around her legs. She is the patron of witches, herbalists, and traditional healers. Appropriate offerings to Pachamama include corn, grain, bread, and sweet pastries as well as herding animals (llamas such as llamas). But what pleases Pachamama most are those who live in accordance with Her ways and in balance and harmony with the earth.

title: “Pretty lady” of Tlatilco
images: ["abo.prettylady.jpg","abo.prettylady2.jpg"]
origin: Tlatilco Valley, Mexico
size: 9.5 inches / 24 cm high
---
Many female terracotta figurines similar to the one displayed here have been excavated in the Tlatilco Valley  near Mexico City. They have been given the name “Pretty Ladies of Tlatilco.” Little is known about the function of these objects. They may have been related to women's fertility role. The figures are small breasted with narrow waists, stumpy arms and ample thighs, representing both young girls and mature women. Many are dual-faced, sharing a central eye. Some are naked while others wear short skirts and applied ornaments. The Tlatilco culture dates from about 1200-200 bce. The “Pretty Lady” displayed here is also a flute. Her headdress is the mouthpiece while her legs supply the finger holes.

title: Day of the Dead catrina
images: ["abo.dayofdead.jpg"]
origin: Mexico
size:
---
A type of Memorial Day in Mexico is called Day of the Dead held the first two days of November in which people gather to remember, honour and celebrate the lives of family and friends who have died. The festival is thought to have originated as an ancient Aztec celebration held during the ninth month of the Aztec calendar. Images of humorous skeleton figures called La Calavera Catrina (The Elegant Skull) are popular during the festival. The small catrina displayed here wears a sombrero and is dressed in black funeral garb displaying the legend of the founding of Mexico City when the god Huitzilopochtli led the people to an island in Lake Texcoco to witness an eagle perched on a cactus holding a snake in its talons. The modern city of Mexico City is built upon that lake. The colour of the sash (green, white and red) are the colours of the flag of Mexico.

title: “Bison” by Benjamin Chee Chee
images: ["abo.bisoncheechee.jpg"]
origin: Ontario, Canada
date: 1960s
size:
---
Born in Temagami, Ontario, March 26, 1944, Ojibway Native Benjamin Chee Chee largely taught himself to draw and paint. A troubled childhood saw the death of his father when Chee Chee was two months old and the lost of contact with mother. He was a prominent member of the second generation of Woodland Indian painters, a Native art movement that began in the early 1960s and became an important school of art in Canada. Unlike many of his contemporary Native artists, Chee Chee pursued a more graphic, abstract style of line image more in keeping with the mainstream of international modern art. Chee Chee is best known for his graceful line impressions of Canada geese. Although the print displayed here entitled “Bison” is somewhat abstract, it is nevertheless rather uncharacteristic of Chee Chee’s better known line technique. At the age of 32 after finally reuniting with his mother and at the height of a new-found success, Chee Chee tragically hanged himself in a jail cell in Ottawa, Ontario, March 14, 1977. His is now one of the notable interments in Ottawa’s Notre-Dame Cemetery. The work “Bison” brings to mind the central significance of the bison to First Nations culture and spirituality.

Smudging is a Native ceremony of purification. Smoke from one or more of four herb medicines (cedar, sweetgrass, tobacco, white sage) is wafted with a feather over the person or object to be blessed and purified. An eagle feather if preferred, but turkey or other feathers may be used. The herb is allowed to smoulder in a container, the most common of which is an abalone shell as displayed here.

title: Navajo sand painting
images: ["abo.sandpainting.jpg"]
origin: North America
size:
---
Sand paintings in the Navajo tradition are for healing purposes. A shaman draws an image in coloured sand on the ground and places the patient in the middle of the design. The order and symmetry of the painting is symbolic of the restored balance and harmony sought for the patient. The painting is considered a portal through which spiritual power may enter and work. Sand from particularly powerful portions of the picture are rubbed or placed on the patient. The figure in the sand painting displayed here is Yeibichai, a mythological holy being. The shaman invokes the blessing and intervention of Yeibichai on behalf of the patient. After the ceremony the painting is destroyed, thus destroying the illness. As many as 1000 sacred designs are known by the Navajo with as many as 30 or more used in a single ceremony.

title: Hina (The Pearl Goddess)
images: ["abo.hina.jpg"]
origin: Polynesia
size:
---
Hina, literally “young girl,” is a general term for a genre of Polynesia goddess figures. Many legends of Polynesian mythology feature a character named Hina. What is unique and fascinating about the image of Hina displayed here is her bhumisparsha (earth-touching) posture identical to that of the enlightened Buddha (see bhumisparsha mudra). The Bhumisparsha Hina was purchased in Tahiti at the home of Paul Gauguin, well known for his paintings of Tahitian and Polynesian women. The figure is called Idole a la Perle “The Pearl Goddess.”

White sage is one of the four medicines of Native Spirituality. Smoke from white sage has a sweet aroma and is considered particularly powerful in removing negativity. The other three medicines are sweetgrass, cedar, and tobacco. The sprigs of white sage displayed here were gifted to Encounter by a student in appreciation for a teaching session.

A digeridoo is a musical instrument of the aboriginal people of northern Australia developed some 1500 years ago. By placing one end over the mouth and using a controlled breathing and puffing action, a unique, ethereal-like sound is produced. As with all ancient aboriginal music, the drone of the digeridoo carries magical, spiritual qualities. Instruments are sometimes decorated with mystical designs and totem animals. The digeridoo displayed here is decorated with a gecko-like figure.
