The word “aboriginal” derives from the Latin ab origine meaning “from the beginning.” Every continent except Antarctica has aboriginal civilizations. A general characteristic of all aboriginal social and religious systems is a holistic approach that seeks interdependent balance and harmony with time, nature, humanity, and the cosmos.

---
Ceremonial masks are a significant element in Native American/First Nations rituals. Great Lakes tribes often carved elaborate false face masks from tree trunks or woven them from corn husks. Because large trees are not plentiful in the prairies, plains Indians fashioned masks from other available materials including bison (buffalo) horns. Horns were boiled until soft, split open, rolled flat, carved with eyes, nose, and mouth holes, then allowed to dry and harden.

---
The bullroarer is an ancient ritual musical instrument dating to the Paleolithic period, 17,000 BCE. In ancient Greece it was a sacred instrument used in the mystery religions. In Australia, bullroarers accompanied didgeridoos in initiation ceremonies and burial rites to ward off evil spirits. Many Native tribes in North America used bullroarers in religious and healing ceremonies. Bullroarers were considered men's secret business by some cultures which women, children, non-initiated men and outsiders were forbidden to hear. Held by the handle and swung around the head, the spinning propeller’s deep humming sound represents the mysterious voice of the Sacred or of ancestors and solemnly announces the beginning of ceremonies.

Eshu is a trickster god of the Yoruba culture of Nigeria, West Africa. He is often found at crossroads and at times of decision making. Eshu is often shown wearing a large hat. His role is to upset the equilibrium when individuals or societies become too staid, apathetic, set in their ways or take things for granted. Legends about Eshu sometimes have him saying the phrase: “Spreading strife is my greatest joy.”

Displayed is a grey stone gorget (ornament or decoration) worn on a leather cord around the neck by Native Americans as a type of decoration or breastplate. During the 1800s these adornments were referred to as “peep stones” or “seer stones” by some non-Natives who claimed to receive revelations by looking (peeping) through the holes in the stone. A "peep stone" similar to this is featured in Latter-day Saint history as a tool used by Joseph Smith, Jr. to translate the Book of Mormon and receive revelations.

A marae is a sacred place serving both religious and social purposes in ancient Polynesian societies. Most marae were destroyed or abandoned with the arrival of Christianity in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Stones such as the ones shown here were used to construct the marae and are still considered powerfully sacred and said to contain "mana" or spiritual energy of the cosmic, impersonal force of the universe.

size: 5 inches / 13 cm.
---
Pachamama (also Pachi Mama, Patchi-Mama) or “World Mother” is a goddess of the indigenous people of the Andes. Incan mythology honours her as the goddess of fertility, planting, the growing season, and the harvest. The version of Pachamama displayed here is three-faced, reminiscent of the Triple Goddess (Maiden, Mother, Crone) of Neo-Paganism. Pachamama is the Quechan or Inca word for “Mother Earth” or literally “Our Mother in Space and Time.” Most ancient cultures have an Earth Mother concept. But the word “Pachamama” goes beyond the name of a single goddess. It encompasses an entire world view and way of life. It involves the belief that the Earth is a living entity and the Mother of all Earth's life. In traditional societies, grown children were expected to take care of their parents, and, thus, it is expected that we all care for Pachamama as our Great Mother. Pachamama cares for her children as a mother cares for her young and does not turn away from them. If she fails to provide, it is because she is ill or has not be treated well. In the modern, blended Christian and Native traditions of South America, Pachamama is often associated with the Virgin Mary and the median between the opposites of Heaven and Hell, God and Satan, or good and evil. Unfortunately, Christian groups have sought to remove Pachamama altogether. Images of Pachamama often have three heads, a turtle on her front, a frog on her back, and a snake around her legs. She is the patron of witches, shaman, herbalists, and traditional healers. Appropriate offerings to Pachamama include corn, grain, bread, and sweet pastries as well as herding animals such as llamas. But what pleases Pachamama most are those who live in accordance with Her ways and in balance and harmony with the earth.

Many female terracotta figurines similar to the one displayed here have been excavated in the Tlatilco Valley near Mexico City. They have been given the name “Pretty Ladies of Tlatilco.” Little is known about the function of these objects. They may have been related to women's fertility role. The figures are small breasted with narrow waists, stumpy arms and ample thighs, representing both young girls and mature women. Many are dual-faced, sharing a central eye. Some are naked while others wear short skirts and applied ornaments. The Tlatilco culture dates from about 1200-200 BCE. The “Pretty Lady” displayed here is also a flute. Her headdress is the mouthpiece while her legs supply the finger holes.

A type of Memorial Day in Mexico called "Day of the Dead" is held the first two days of November in which people gather to remember, honour and celebrate the lives of family and friends who have died. The festival is thought to have originated as an ancient Aztec celebration held during the ninth month of the Aztec calendar. Images of humorous skeleton figures called La Calavera Catrina (The Elegant Skull) are popular during the festival. The small catrina displayed here wears a sombrero and is dressed in black funeral garb displaying the legend of the founding of Mexico City when the god Huitzilopochtli led the people to an island in Lake Texcoco to witness an eagle perched on a cactus holding a snake in its talons. The modern city of Mexico City is built upon that lake. The colour of the sash (green, white and red) are the colours of the flag of Mexico.

title: “Bison” by Benjamin Chee Chee

origin: Ontario, Canada
date: 1960s
size:
---
Born in Temagami, Ontario, March 26, 1944, Ojibway Native Benjamin Chee Chee largely taught himself to draw and paint. A troubled childhood saw the death of his father when Chee Chee was two months old and the loss of contact with his mother. He was a prominent member of the second generation of Woodland Indian painters, a Native art movement that began in the early 1960s and became an important school of art in Canada. Unlike many of his contemporary Native artists, Chee Chee pursued a more graphic, abstract style of line image more in keeping with the mainstream of international modern art. Chee Chee is best known for his graceful line impressions of Canada geese. The print displayed here entitled “Bison” is somewhat abstract and rather uncharacteristic of Chee Chee’s better known line technique. The work brings to mind the central significance of the bison to First Nations culture and spirituality. At the age of 32 after finally reuniting with his mother and at the height of a new-found success, Chee Chee tragically hanged himself in a jail cell in Ottawa, Ontario, March 14, 1977. His is now one of the notable interments in Ottawa’s Notre-Dame Cemetery.

title: Navajo Sand Painting Box
images: ["abo.sandpainting.jpg"]
origin: Arizona
size: 7.5 inches / 19 cm. square
---
Sand paintings in the Navajo culture are for healing purposes. A shaman draws an image in coloured sand on the ground and places the patient in the middle of the design. The order and symmetry of the painting is symbolic of the restored balance and harmony sought for the patient. The painting is considered a portal through which spiritual power may enter and work. Sand from particularly powerful portions of the picture are rubbed or placed on the patient. The figure in the sand painting displayed here is Yeibichai, a mythological holy being. The shaman invokes the blessing and intervention of Yeibichai on behalf of the patient. After the ceremony the sand painting is destroyed, thus destroying the illness. Approximately 1,000 sacred designs are known by the Navajo with perhaps 30 or more used in a single ceremony.

Hina, literally “young girl,” is a general term for a genre of Polynesia goddess figures. Many legends of Polynesian mythology feature a character named Hina. What is unique and fascinating about the image of Hina displayed here is her bhumisparsha (earth-touching) posture identical to that of the enlightened Buddha (see bhumisparsha mudra). The Bhumisparsha Hina was purchased in Tahiti at the home of Paul Gauguin, well known for his paintings of Tahitian and Polynesian women. The figure is called Idole a la Perle “The Pearl Goddess.”

A digeridoo is a musical instrument of the aboriginal people of northern Australia developed some 1500 years ago. By placing one end over the mouth and using a controlled breathing and puffing action, a unique, ethereal-like sound is produced. As with most ancient aboriginal music, the drone of the digeridoo carries magical, spiritual qualities. Instruments are sometimes decorated with mystical designs and totem animals. The digeridoo displayed here is decorated with a gecko-like figure.

Ceremonial masks are a significant element in the Woodland First Nations False Face Society. False face masks have been used in ceremonies asking for success in hunts, abundance in harvests, and for safe passage of loved ones to the other side. Members of False Face societies also used masks to cure illnesses, alleviate pain and drive out negative spirits. Great Lakes tribes often carved elaborate false face masks from tree trunks. Perhaps the most well-known mask of Woodland First Nations False Face Societies is Hadui or "The Face" sometimes called Broken Nose. Shown here is a small 7 inch/17.5 cm model of a Hadui face carved in a tree. A full-size face and tree trunk and the legend of Hadui are elsewhere in this collection.

Sweetgrass is one of four sacred medicines in Native spirituality used in the smudging ceremony. One or more of four ingredients called medicines (tobacco, white sage, cedar, sweetgrass) are placed in a shell or other container and lit on fire. Smoke from the smoldering elements is fanned over a person as they symbolically wash themselves in the purifying smoke. Spaces (rooms, buildings) and objects (drums, sacred pipes) may be smudged with the purifying, sanctify smoke as well. In some Native stories, sweetgrass was the first plant on earth. Using it shows respect and honour to the earth. Other stories refer to sweetgrass as the hair of Mother Earth. The three-part braid may be understood to reprsent body-mind-spirit or past-present-future.
