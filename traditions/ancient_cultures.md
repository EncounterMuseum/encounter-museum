Asherah is a major Semite Goddess of fertility known as the Queen of Heaven. There are some forty references to Asherah in the Bible indicating she was worshipped in Israel and Judea. In ancient times, Hebrews baked small cakes in the form of Asherah and ate them in celebration of her festival day.  (Jeremiah 44.17 and 7.17, 18 – “The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods…to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem.”

Cylinder seals were first made in Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq, around 3500 BCE. Paper had not been invented, so documents were written in cuneiform on clay tablets. Cylinder seals were rolled across the wet clay to make an impression to indicate that the message on the tablet was official. This seal shows two priest standing on either side of an altar above which shines a celestial light.

The most spectacular monument in Malta is the enormous, underground sanctuary known as the Hypogeum discovered in 1902 by workers digging a cistern. The catacomb-like structure seems to have been a major temple for the island. It is the only underground temple in the world still existing from prehistoric times, dating back some 5,000 years. The main hall leads into an oracle room where two small identical sculptures of a woman were found lying on the floor where they were probably left when the shrine was abandoned millennia ago. Because her real name is unknown, she has been called the Venus of Malta or the Dreamer of Malta. She is lying on her side on a low couch, asleep and almost visibly dreaming. The figures may have been part of a dream incubation or dreamtime ceremony in which the goddess, like Vishnu of Hinduism, dreams the world into existence. The originals are on display in Malta’s National Museum of Archaeology.

Willendorf is a city in Austria. A small stone figure of a woman was found there in 1908. The object is believed to date from 24,000-22,000 BCE. The figure is distinctly female with typical features of other ancient fertility goddess art (i.e. large breasts and hips, suggestion of vulva, featureless head and undefined limbs). The original is in the Natural History Museum, Vienna, Austria.


The Venus of Willendorf was found by the researcher Szombathy on the 7th of August, 1908. It is made out of limestone and still has some signs of red pigmentation; it fits in the palm of a hand. It is one of the most obese representations of the Paleolithic statuary. She represents the Earth and its fertility and continuation of life, the Mother Goddess, the universal female principle even if it is in its most primitive conception. Women were recognized as the life-givers and sustainers. They were revered as priestesses. Upper Paleolithic female figures, such as this one are found from the Pyrenees mountains to Siberia, indicating that East and West were once united in honouring the Goddess. The vast majority (over 90%) of human images from 30,000 to 5,000 BCE are female.

images: ["anc.anubis.jpg","anc.anubis2.jpg","anc.anubisstanding.jpg","anc.anubisstanding2.jpg","anc.anubisstanding3.jpg"]
origin: Ancient Egypt
size:
---
Anubis is the jackal-head Egyptian god of mummification and the afterlife. According to Egyptian mythology, Anubis invented the art of mummification. As shown here, Anubis is often depicted in a funerary setting attending the sarcophagus of a mummy. The ceremonial dress of chief embalmers in ancient Egypt often included a portrayal of Anubis who was believed to be present at all mummifications. The deceased who Anubis attends to here is Sennedjem whose title “Servant in the Place of Truth,” indicated he was one of the main artisans in the tombs of the pharaohs. Sennedjem’s own tomb and wall painting of this scene was discovered in 1886 in The Valley of the Kings, Thebes, Egypt.



The God Anubis is represented here embalming the body of the high official Sennedjem. The term embalming (Senefer) means "to give vitality again" and the embalming house (per nefer) means "the house of vitality". For the Egyptians, death was transitory and the mummification allowed the deceased to be prepared for the trip to the underworld and immortality. The process of mummification lasted seventy days. First, the body had ritual washings, then, most of the brain was taken out through an opening in the nose. The rest was dissolved with aromatic products. The heart, lungs and viscera were taken out and placed in four jars. The heart was replaced by one of ceramic or stone. The body submerged for seventy days in dry natron became incorruptible and finally it was washed, dried and bandaged with fine linen at the same time that sacred formulas were chanted.

Unlike the well-known image of the Egyptian Sphinx, the Greek Sphinx is female, represented as a creature with a woman’s head, a lion’s body, an eagle’s wings, and a serpent-headed tail. The Greek Sphinx was the emblem of the ancient city-state of Chios and appeared on seals and the obverse side of coins from the 6th century BCE until the 3rd century CE. Images of Greek Sphinx were often placed atop columns in temple courtyards.



The Greek Sphinx had a woman's head, lion's body, serpent's tail and eagle's wings. Sent by Hera to punish Thebes for displeasing the Goddess, she settled on Mount Phicium, near the city and asked everyone who passed by to answer a riddle she had learned from the three Muses: "What being, with only one voice, has sometimes two fee, sometimes three, sometimes four, and is weakest when it has the most?" Anyone unable to render the correct answer was immediately slain. One day Oedipus chanced along that road and guessed the answer: "Man, because he crawls on all four as an infant, stands firmly on his two feet in his youth and leans on a staff in his old age." Completely shattered by her defeat, the Sphinx threw herself from the mountain and Oedipus was acclaimed King. The people from the island of Naxos gave this sphinx to the city of Delphi as a gift to the oracle.

The pottery shards displayed here are from the city of Caesarea, Israel, on the coast of the Mediterranean, a city King Herod the Great dedicated to Caesar Augustus about 25 BCE. The area is known for its picturesque and magnificent Roman aqueducts. Caesarea was the capital of Roman and Byzantine Palestine and the home of Roman governors (procurators) of Judea, including Pontius Pilate. Stone seats in the ancient amphitheatre there still show the carved names “Tiberium” and “Tius Pilatus,” references to Emperor Tiberius and Pontius Pilate. Although it is unknown who owned these jugs, the shards were retrieved in 2004 from debris of an archaeological dig of Pilate’s house and neighbouring residences. The city of Caesarea features prominently in Acts 10 of the Christian scriptures as the home of the Roman centurion, Cornelius, whose vision prompted the coming of Peter to Caesarea resulting in the first Gentile baptisms in the new Jewish-Christian movement.

The ancient Marajoara tribe of Brazil was an advanced pre-Columbian culture that flourished in the Marajo Islands at the mouth of the Amazon River. The height of the civilization was 800-1400 CE and possibly as early as 1,000 BCE. Sophisticated pottery incised with mystic patterns and distinctive shaped eyes have been discovered. Many jar figures have nearly non-existent legs and small, thin arms. Prominent among the incised designs on Encounter’s jar the mandorla or vesica piscis symbolic of the female.

Earliest cave paintings date from more than 32,000 years ago. Many paintings involved animals and hunting scenes. While the exact purpose of the paintings is unknown, speculation is that the function had to do with sympathetic magic. That is, painting large herds and successful hunts brought about the reality. The first example displayed here is a hand painted image on red sandstone of two human figures engaged in a hunt. The gray faux stone second example is a manufactured reproduction of a shaman figure wearing an antler headdress, raising his right arm in authority, and holding staff in his left hand. A circle ornament is around his left arm. Under his right arm is a bird-like figure.

Stonehenge in England is one of the most well known pre-historic sites in the world. The circle of stones was constructed 3000 to 2000 BCE. No written record of the people who built Stonehenge remains. The structure’s purpose and function, how and why it was created is, therefore, a mystery. Displayed here is a model of how Stonehenge may have looked originally. This model was purchased at the Stonehenge site.



Around 3000 BCE (middle Neolithic) the semi nomadic peoples that populated the Salisbury Plain began to build Stonehenge as the center of a ceremonial site. We know almost nothing about who built it. A popular theory attributed it to the Druids but modern dating shows it to be at least a 1000 years before the Druids came to power. Stonehenge was built as an astronomical calendar aligned with lunar and solar events such as the summer solstice where the sun rises directly over the Heel Stone and the first rays shine into the center of the monument between the open arms of the horseshoe arrangements. Built in three phases between 2950 BCE and 1600 BCE, the original construction was a circular ditch and mound with 56 holes forming a ring. The first stone placed at the site was the Heel stone erected outside of the entrance to the site. 200 years later 80 blocks of bluestone were erected forming two concentric circles. At some point this construction was dismantled and the final phase of the site begun. The bluestones were moved within the circle and the gigantic stones and lintels that give Stonehenge its distinctive look were installed. Some of these stones weigh 26 tons. It remains a mystery how such huge stones were moved from the quarry by a supposedly primitive people.

origin: Phaistos, Crete

The Phaistos Disc is from the Minoan palace of Phaistos on the Greek island of Crete. The original from the late Bronze Age is about 5 inches across made of fired clay. The disc is covered front and back with a spiral of enigmatic alphabet-like designs. A translation or meaning of the letters has never been deciphered. King Minos of Phaistos is linked in legend to the spiralling labyrinth pattern, so a design such as this from the Minoan palace is fitting. The Phaistos Disc replica displayed here was purchased in Phaistos, Crete.

The triple spiral is an ancient Celtic design found in several Irish pre-Celtic Neolithic sites. The most famous is on the 3200 BCE entrance stone of the tomb passage at Newgrange mound in Ireland. In Neo-Pagan traditions, the triple spiral symbolizes the Three Realms of Land-Sea-Sky or represents various triple deities. Wicca employs the triple spiral as symbolic of the Triple Goddess of Maiden-Mother-Crone.

title: Right eye of Horus (Wedjat)
images: ["anc.eyeofhorus.jpg","anc.eyeofhorus2.jpg"]
origin: Ancient Egypt
size:
---
In Egyptian mythology, the Eye of Horus (also called wedjat) is a symbol of protection and power. Horus was the ancient Egyptian sky god usually depicted as a falcon. Horus’ right eye was associated with the sun Ra. The left eye sometimes represented the moon and the god Thoth.  In one myth, during a battle between Horus and his brother Set, Horus’ eye was gouged out. His father, Osiris, restored it. The eye of Horus has, therefore, become a symbol of sacrifice, healing, and restoration. Displayed here is a pendent of Horus’ right eye made of silver and purchased in Aswan, Egypt.

Isis is a goddess of Egyptian mythology representing the ideal Mother and wife. She is the Queen of Heaven, and her child, Osiris, is both child and bridegroom. The comparison between the Egyptian Isis and the Christian Mary is obvious. The ancient image of her functioning as a type of throne upon which sits the destined King Osiris is considered a model for later Christian artists depicting Madonna and Child. Another image of Isis (not shown) is with her dead son draped across her lap as she grieves – a type of Pieta. The crown of Isis in the small image are the horns of a cow supporting the solar disc. Sometimes Isis is represented hieroglyphically as a cow head.

title: Mithra slaying the bull
images: ["anc.mithrabull.jpg"]
origin: Ancient Greece and Rome
date: ca. 1600 BCE - 350 CE
size:
---
Mystery religions were practiced in the Greco-Roman world from approximately 1600 BCE-350 CE. The practices were known as mystery religions for two reasons: because the teachings were known only to initiates and, therefore, a “mystery” to the uninitiated; because the religions dealt with esoteric, spiritual, “mysterious” beliefs. One of these mystery religions worshipped Lord Mithras. The tradition had a complex system of initiation levels, secret (sacred) meetings closed to the public, sacred meals involving washing in and possibly drinking blood, etc. The date of Mithras’ birth, December 25, was annually celebrated as the coming of the earthly incarnation of eternal light. The central icon of Mithraism was an image of the slaying of the sacred bull. More than 500 such images have been found. The accompanying legend tells how Mithras hunted the bull, rode it to exhaustion, then led it into a cavern. The icon shows Mithras in a traditional cloak and cap kneeling before an exhausted bull. With his right leg, Mithras restrains the bull’s back hoof. With his left leg, Mithras holds down the bull. His left hand grasps the bull’s nose and pulls back the head. His right hand stabs the bull’s shoulder. As he stabs the bull, Mithras turns his head to look at Sol Invictus, the invincible Sun God who watches the astonishing spectacle of sacrifice from his heavenly home. The bull represents the sacrifice of old life for the sake of new life. A dog laps the bull’s blood while a snake reaches toward the wound. The dog lapping blood may represent protected passage to an afterlife or next phase of life. The snake is a symbol of regeneration and life. A scorpion seizes the bull's genitals. Both the scorpion and the injured testicles represent death. Mithras’ bull-killing sacrifice was ritually re-enacted in Mithraic sacraments. Because it was a mystery religion, the exact meaning is speculation. The scene may have link with the Zodiac, constellations, and various stars implying celestial connection e.g. the bull of Taurus, the sword of Aries, the scorpion of Scorpio, the snake of Hydra, the dog of Canis Minor, and Mithras himself as Orion. Initiates were washed in the blood of the sacrificed bull which washed away past transgressions and initiated them into the faith.

A libation cup holds liquid, usually wine or mead, for drinking and pouring as an offering to a god or spirit during a religious ritual. The cup displayed here is after the style of an ancient Norse libation cup. It is made of metal in the fashion of a mythical ram or goat with large horns, symbolic of regenerative power. The body of the beast is covered with feathers and has wings decorated with double spiral designs. Behind the wings are swooping tail feathers. The combined earth animal and bird imagery is symbolic of linking sacred and secular realities. Each side of the rim of the cup has a fanciful dragon, symbol of energy and vitality, emerging from cloud-like swirls suggestive of the celestial realm from which it comes.

title: Weighing of the heart
images: ["anc.weighingoftheheart.jpg"]
origin: Cairo, Egypt

For ancient Egyptians, behaviour during life was judged after death before being granted a place in the afterlife. This judgment was called “The Weighing of the Heart.” A giant scale weighed the deceased's heart against the principle of truth and justice (maat) represented by a feather. The ancient Egyptians considered the heart the centre of thought, memory, emotion, intellect and personality. The heart was essential for rebirth into the afterlife. If the heart weighed equal to or less than the feather, the deceased was granted a place in the afterlife. If the heart was heavy with the weight of wrong doing, the balance sank, and the heart was grabbed and devoured by a terrifying beast called Ammit (the gobbler) that sat ready and waiting by the scales. The deceased then ceased to exist. The ceremony took place before Osiris and a tribunal deities. Standing before the tribunal (at the top of the picture) the deceased declared himself innocent of wrong doing towards the gods and his fellow men. Members of the tribunal were gods assembled from all over Egypt and had such names as Bone-Crusher, Shining-Tooth, Blood-Consumer, Flint-Eyes, Entrails-Consumer, etc. Proceedings were recorded by Thoth, the scribe of the gods and deity of wisdom who gave humanity the hieroglyphs He is often depicted as a human with the head of an ibis bird. Once the deceased had been justified in the eyes of the immortals he was worthy of the weighing process. Anubis, master of ceremonies, led the deceased by the hand to the scales in the Hall of Maat. In his left hand Anubis holds an ankh, the symbol of life. The scales were topped by Maat, goddess of Justice, Truth and Order, wearing a feather on her head. Ammit, Devourer of the Dead, awaited the verdict. A jar containing the heart was placed on one of the pans of the scale, while the feather of Maat weighed down the other pan. Anubis did the weighing, giving the scales a benevolent nudge in the right direction with the ankh. Having passed the test, the deceased followed Horus (holding an ankh) to meet Osiris, with whom he will be identified as a follower. He was received by Osiris and his two sisters, Isis and Nephthys. The four sons of Horus stood on a lotus flower growing out of the waters over which sat the throne of Osiris. Overhead flew the winged image of Maat. The image displayed here is hand painted on handmade papyrus and purchased in Cairo, Egypt.

title: Mayan triple face
images: ["anc.aztectripleface.jpg"]
origin: Yucatan, Mexico
date: pre-Columbus America
size:
---
This Mayan mask shows the different stages of life as part of a never ending circle of human evolution through life and the afterlife as it was understood by the Mayas. The mask has three layered faces, each representing one particular stage of life. The inner face represents the beginning of life at birth. The middle face represents the adult stage when the person comes into his full potential and most of his life experiences happen. The outer or third face represents the end of earthly life. The sacred time of death was viewed by the Maya as the end of one cycle and the beginning of another one. Lavish preparations for the next life followed death. The mask’s representative transformations from life-death-life may be understood as either actual, physical birth-life-death-resurrection/reincarnation or metaphoric transformations of spiritual, psychological stages.

origin: Mesopotamia
size:

So common in the Mesopotamian area were the clay figurines of Ishtar/Inanna/Ashtart in her characteristic breast-offering pose, that this has come to be known among archaeologists as "The Ishtar Pose". She was addressed as "Mother of the Fruitful Breast", Queen of Heaven, Light of the World, Creator of People, Mother of Deities, River of Life, Etc. The breast-offering pose suggested her function as the Goddess of all nourishment and fertility. Ishtar, also know as Inanna in Sumeria is, above all, a lunar Goddess who gives life as the waxing moon and then withdraws it as the waning moon. The light and dark dimensions to her power, her dying and resurrected son-lover Tammaz, who annually descends to the underworld and rises again from it all suggests a lunar mythology which revolves around the connection made between the light and dark lunar phases and rhythmic alteration of the Earth's fertility.

title: Isis with Horus
images: ["anc.isishorus.jpg", "anc.isishorussmall.jpg"]
origin: Ancient Egypt

The name Isis means "seat" or "throne". She was regarded as the symbolical mother of the King. In myth, she sought her dead husband and brother, Osiris, conceived her son Horus by him, buried and mourned him together with her sister Nephtys. Isis was regarded as the "Eye of Ra" and was worshipped as the "Great of Magic" who had protected her son Horus from snakes, predators and other dangers: thus she would protect mortal children also. Isis is here depicted as a mother suckling her young son Horus and it is in this aspect that the Goddess was regarded as the vital link between Deities and Royalty, since the King was regarded as the living Horus on the throne of Egypt. In the pyramid texts it's stated that the ruler drinks divine milk from the breast of his mother Isis: This is the imagery of the plethora of statuettes of Isis seated on a throne suckling the young Horus who sits in her lap.

The Venus of Lespugue was found in 1922 by Saint Perrier in the cave of Les Rideaux. The sculpture is made out of mammoth ivory and measures 5.75" high. The breasts are deteriorated but they have been restored in this reproduction so that we can appreciate the original look of the statue. She represents the Earth and it's fertility and the continuation of life, The Mother Goddess, the universal female principle even if it is in its most primitive conception. Upper Paleolithic female figures such as this one are found from the Pyrenees mountains to Siberia, indicating that East and West were once united in honouring the Goddess. The vast majority (over 90%) of human images from 30,000 to 5,000 BCE. are female. Women were recognized as the life-givers and sustainers and they were revered as priestesses.

Akhenaton, originally named Amenhotep IV, ruled Egypt for 17 years (1367-1350 BCE) together with his beautiful Queen Nefertiti, he was Son of Amenhotep III. The priesthood of Amun at Thebes, enormously enriched by the tribute donated by the Pharaohs to the God, became the real power. Like his father before him, Akhenaton initially recognized the power of the priests of Amun at Thebes but after the fifth year of his reign, he changed the state cult of Amun to that of Aten, the unique God represented as the sun-disk with its rays ending in small hands. He also assumed the name Akhenaton ("the glory of the Aten"). This began two decades of religious reforms overthrowing millenia of traditional religious and civil life. Here, Akhenaton together with his wife Nefertiti and one of their daughters are seen worshipping the Aten.

The eye of Horus also called Oudjat or Wedjat, is the left lunar eye which originates from the struggle between Horus and Seth. In this fight, Horus loses his left eye which is taken by Seth, but then Horus acquires spiritual sight, the eye of light. The eye was later healed by Thoth and returned to Horus and then called "the Oudjat" ("the Whole One"). It was a symbol of the power of the God of light, and therefore a popular amulet for protection and good luck. Some Oudjat eyes had an arm carrying the Ankh or the papyrus staff, symbol for "to flourish". The eye of Horus was also used as a protection against the evil eye. From the late old kingdom, two Oudjat eyes were placed on the door recesses of tombs.
