The book, divided into five parts, is a collection of writings called “tablets” by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Baha’i faith. The selection, sometimes simply called Gleanings, was made in by Shoghi Effendi, great grandson of the founding prophet and third leader of the faith, and published in 1935. Following are sample quotations from the Bahá'u'lláh:
•	“Do not be content with showing friendship in words alone, let your heart burn with loving kindness for all who may cross your path.”
•	“The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.”
•	“A thankful person is thankful under all circumstances. A complaining soul complains even in paradise.”
•	“Religious fanaticism and hatred are a world-devouring fire, whose violence none can quench.”
•	“The essence of faith is fewness of words and abundance of deeds.”
