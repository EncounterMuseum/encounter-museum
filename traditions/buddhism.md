origin: Nepal
size:

Shown is a three dimensional mandala symbolic of the universe and Mt. Meru, the cosmic mountain of Hindu and Buddhist cosmology similar to Mt. Olympus in Greek cosmology. Mt. Meru is a purified space where endless compassion and enlightenment are a gift to all beings. The large container is turned upside down and subsequent concentric circles built upon its surface. Each circle is filled with seeds, shells, stones, and objects of personal significance. A crown displaying an endless knot of compassion and shell of transformation adorns the completed top circle. The finished mandala is held and offered as an act of generosity to the world.

A thangka is a banner painting depicting some Buddhist teaching which is hung in a monastery or a family altar and occasionally carried by monks in ceremonial processions. The hand painted thangka displayed here is of Yama, the Lord of Death, who holds in his mouth the Wheel of Life. On the rim of the Wheel, twelve scenes symbolize the twelve links of dependent origination. The spokes of the Wheel separate into six realms (three upper and three lower), none of which is permanent. It is notable that regardless of the realm, the Buddha is always present, guiding and compassionate. At the hub of the Wheel, which has set the whole thing in motion, are the three driving forces: the pig of ignorance, the rooster of greed, and the serpent of aggression. The Wheel can also be understood as a mirror. Yama holds it up to each person, and in it we recognize the reflection of our own existence. At the top of the scene the Buddha at the upper right is pointing to the rabbit in the moon representing ultimate non-attachment and self-giving. Thus only as we understand the truth communicated by the Buddha can we transform our delusion to knowledge. The unenlightened do not see the moon but only the Buddha’s finger.

A thangka is a banner painting depicting some Buddhist teaching which is hung in a monastery or a family altar and occasionally carried by monks in ceremonial processions. The two hand painted thangkas displayed here are of Yama, the Lord of Death, sometimes called The Wrathful Buddha who presides over the realms of hell. His purpose is to bring about release from psychological states of suffering. The artistic work on these thangkas is so fine that some portions are painted with brushes of a single hair.

title: Four Harmonious Friends (cloth printed mural)
images: ["bud.4friends.jpg"]
origin: Tibet (donated)

“The Four Harmonious Friends” is a parable of the Buddha. Once four friends, an elephant, a monkey, a peacock and a rabbit wished to have a constant supply of the fruit they all loved to eat. After some deliberation, they decided that through cooperation they could achieve this. So, the peacock found the seed of the fruit tree and planted it. The rabbit brought water for it. The monkey tended it. And the elephant guarded it day and night. The seed became a mature tree and produced the longed for fruit. When the fruit was ripe, none of the animals could harvest the highest fruit on the most delicate branches. So they made a tower by climbing on each other’s backs. Through their friendship and cooperation the four were able to attain what they longed for most. The reason the four animals worked so harmoniously and successfully together is that none was primarily concerned with self. Rather than being dominated by selfish concern, each recognized the gifts of the other and was concerned with trying to help others get what they needed. None wanted to be the hero. A number of explanations exist for the symbolism of the animals:

Some say the four represent a cooperation of body, mind, emotions and soul.

Others say they represent peace, harmony, co-operation, and interdependence.

Another explanation says this teaching of the Buddha expresses an opposition and dismantling of the four major caste systems of India.

Still others say the pyramid of friends represents the idea that every successor or generation stands on the shoulders of those who went before.

Particularly in Tibet, this scene is sometimes painted on banners and hung over openings of Buddhist temple doors.

Sarira are pearl or crystal-like stones found among cremated ashes of the Buddha and other enlightened beings. Because these relics are thought to embody the wisdom, knowledge, teachings, realizations, and consciousness of the deceased spiritual master, they have significant importance in many sects of Buddhism. It is customary in Thailand to place sarira in shrines or wear them in small pendent reliquaries. Sarira are believed to promote blessings and ward off evil. Healings and visions are attributed to simply being in their presence. Sarira are said mysteriously to appear, multiply or disappear depending on the chi (energy) of the keeper and surroundings. Displayed here is a small pendent of sarira for wearing around the neck. The other exhibit displays sarira inside a small clear Lucite stupa reliquary.

Keisaku (Japanese) or Kyosaku (Chinese) is a flat wooden stick used in Zen Buddhism to strike meditators across the shoulders to remedy sleepiness or lapses of concentration. Striking with a keisaku is not an act of violence. It is considered an act of compassion, invigorating the meditator and encouraging continued meditation in mindfulness. Occasionally a meditator may offer his back to the monitor, thereby requesting a strike to rejuvenate his efforts. Thus, the keisaku is sometimes called an encouragement stick.

Used mostly in Tibetan Buddhism, the melong (ritual mirror) is symbolic of the mind deluded by appearances and illusion. When meditators considers that the image in the mirror is not them – only an illusion of them – then the leap is simple to the realization that their physical self is only an illusion of their actual self. Joining the mirror to the wooden handle is a bat, a common symbol in Buddhism because a bat moves through the darkness in the way an enlightened mind moves through ignorance. The brass melong has three small circles in its four cardinal points. The four points represent the four directions as well as the Four Noble Truths. The three circles represent the Three Jewels of Buddhism: the Buddha (teacher/example), the Dharma (teachings), and the Sangha (community of believers).

The jingling of the rings announces the monk’s approach to devotees as well as warns small creatures to scatter to avoid being harmed in the path of the monk’s step. Ksitigarbha uses the  jingle staff to force open the gates of hell. Today the number of rings may vary depending on the monk’s status. and release all occupants.

Briefly told, while in the forest the three brothers discovered a starving mother tigress too weak and emaciated to nurse her cub. Although the three boys were grieved for the mother tiger’s pitiful condition, there was nothing they could do and had no choice but to leave her unassisted. Mahasattva, however, returned, lay down beside her, slit his own throat allowing her to lap his blood. This gave her enough strength to eat Mahasattva completely. This act of selfless sacrifice saved the life of both mother and cub. The king built shrine to Mahasattva who later was reborn as the Buddha.

The most common mantra in Buddhism, particularly Tibetan Buddhism is the six syllable phrase: “Om Mani Padme Hum.” The ubiquitous mantra is found in prayer wheels, prayer flags, inscribed in temples and shrines, and carved in stones. The esoteric meaning of the mantra varies. Literally it means “The Jewel Is In The Lotus,” which may be interpreted to mean enlightenment is in the wisdom teachings, eternal life is in ordinary life, etc. Others say the meaning of the phrase is not the point. The purpose is to experience the pronunciation of the syllables as a means of focusing the mind on attainment of Buddha consciousness.

Literally it means “The Jewel Is In The Lotus,” which may be interpreted to mean enlightenment is in the wisdom teachings, eternal life is in ordinary life, etc. Others say the meaning of the phrase is not the point. The purpose is to experience the pronunciation of the syllables as a means of focusing the mind on attainment of Buddha consciousness. On the back of the stone is a design known as The Eyes of The Buddha or The Eyes of Truth (see respective explanation).

Sometimes called the Happy Buddha or Laughing Buddha, Maitreya, also known as Hotei, is the Future Buddha. Some of the legends, stories and interpretations surrounding him may be found in the two links. A few explanations are as follows:

At his coming, he takes all the world to himself and gives back to the world only the positive energies symbolized by the smile projected to the world.

The sorrow and suffering of the world he keeps to himself. The large belly is said to contain the world’s suffering, and it’s big because there are lots of them. The belly also represents the universe contained within him making him able to supply all the world’s needs.

The backpack he carries tied to a stick over his shoulder is filled with gold coins. The three Chinese characters on the backpack says Yellow Gold Bag.

In his hand is an ancient Chinese gold coin. They are actually quite small but are exaggerated in size so we can see them. This association with wealth is why the practice of rubbing his belly developed in order to receive wealth. Actually, in Buddhism gold is a symbol of wisdom. Thus he offers the world wisdom not literal wealth which would be contrary to the Buddhist virtue of non-attachment to worldly goods.

Maitreya is often a purple-red colour – a Buddhist symbol of compassion. Even his name, Maitreya, means compassion.

The earth bore witness with a 100,000 voices that Siddhartha was the great world teacher. This was the point of enlightenment. At that moment Siddhartha became The Buddha. The platform upon which the Buddha sits is symbolic of the universe as supported by celestial beings, cosmic elephants and the wheel of time.

Many Tibetan Buddhist prayer beads have small bell and dorje counters attached to the string of beads. Two short strings of ten beads each have a miniature bell or dorje at the bottom of each string. The dorje counter beads are used to count each round of one hundred prayer. Although there are 108 beads, each round only amount to 100 to account for mistakes in pronunciation or lapses in concentration. The bell counter beads count are used after each of the 10 dorje beads are used making 1,000 mantras per bead. These counters are placed at different points on the mala depending on tradition, sometimes at the 10th, 21st or 25th bead from the Guru bead, a larger, decorated or knot bead. Traditionally, one begins the recitation at the guru bead and moves in the direction of the dorje (skilful means) proceeding on to the bell (wisdom) with each round.

The actual “meaning” of the statement is not important because the purpose of a koan is to defy logical explanation.

Buddhist incense has a distinctively more woody, spicy aroma than the sweeter smelling Hindu incense. Buddhism uses a combination of three basic essences to dispel the three poison: aloeswood to dispel the poison of ignorance, cloves to dispel the poison of aversion, sandalwood to dispel the poison of attachment. Use of incense, particularly in India, served both practical and spiritual of functions. Burning incense is believed to provide symbolic as well as actual purification. It is a symbol of self sacrifice. The pleasant aroma masks more unpleasant odours and chases away flying insects. Finally, burning incense is a way to signify meditation times and lengths determined by the time it took for a particular length of incense to burn.

A butsuden is a small altar shrine found in Buddhist homes, shops, and temples. Within the butsuden sits one or more images of particularly revered Buddhist figures or icons along with lights, incense, and fruit or flowers or tea as offering. Many Buddhists consider the butsuden essential to a life of religious practice. In the butsuden displayed here is an image of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, also known as Kuan Yin, the bodhisattva (enlightened being) of compassion. Avalokiteshvara is depicted as either male or female; thus, some legends refer to the figure as “he” and others as “she,” and some alternate pronouns. The name means “One Who Looks Down in Compassion.” It is said that when Avalokiteshvara attained enlightenment, he chose to return to earth for the sake of suffering beings rather than enter nirvana. In her left hand he holds a vase of celestial nectar turned downward to pour into the mouth of the dragon of life in the swirling waves of primordial oceans. Her left hand holds closed and open lotuses symbolic of the progression of enlightenment. On the altar are placed electric candles (red the favoured colour), fruit and incense. The incense is in lotus burners. By rotating the bottom of the burner, the petals of the lotus open. One burner is shown open; the other shown closed. Tibetan Buddhism considers the Dalai Lama the reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva.

images: ["bud.avelohead.jpg"]
size:
---
Displayed here is a head image of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, also known as Kuan Yin, the bodhisattva (enlightened being) of compassion. Avalokiteshvara is depicted as either male or female; thus, some legends refer to the figure as “he” and others as “she,” and some alternate pronouns. The name means “One Who Looks Down in Compassion.” It is said that when Avalokiteshvara attained enlightenment, he chose to return to earth for the sake of suffering beings rather than enter nirvana. The image has some usual characteristics of Buddhist images: half-closed eyes focused in meditation, urna (spot) between the eyes representing the third eye of intuition that has vision of the divine world, and elongated ear lobes of one who has many incarnations of listening to the inner divine voice. Whereas images of the Buddha have a rounder face, images of Avalokiteshvara have a more oval shape. The crown she wears is typically associated with Avalokiteshvara. Tibetan Buddhism considers the Dalai Lama the reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva.

Buddhism speaks of all things having a cause, that is, a set of conditions that allowed a thing or event to arise into existence. This philosophy is known as Dependent Origination, Conditioned Genesis, or a number of other terms translated from the Sanskrit pratityasmutpada. A famous rendering of the doctrine is as follows: “The Tathagata (Buddha) has explained the origin of those things which proceed from a cause. Their cessation, too, he has explained. ‘This being, that becomes. From the arising of this, that arises. This not being, that does not become. From the ceasing of this, that ceases.’”  The Chinese characters on either side of the triptych displayed here are simply decoration and are not the pratityasmutpada.

Displayed are two rubbings of bas-relief carvings from the 1,000 year old Wat Pho Buddhist temple in Thailand near the famed bridge on the river Kwai. The temple has 168 panels depicting episodes from the Hindu scripture epic The Ramayana. The rubbings were made on rice paper anchored to the temple wall by thin, flexible bamboo sticks. A cloth-wrapped finger dipped in pigment gently rubbed the surface of the paper to reveal the image beneath.

title: Bodhidharma
images: ["bud.bodhidharma.jpg", "bud.bodhidharma2.jpg"]
origin: Japan
size:
---
Bodhidharma was a Buddhist monk who may have lived in the 400s or 500s ce. The name literally means “enlightened teaching.” He is generally credited with bringing the Zen tradition to China. Legend says that in order to be permitted to teach in the Shaolin temple in China, Bodhidharma meditated in front of a cave wall for nine years to demonstrate his sincerity. He is considered the 28th in succession from Mahakashyapa, the only disciple of the Buddha to understand the meaning of The Flower Sermon which dealt with experience over words (very Zen-like). The small standing figurine of Bodhidharma displayed here shows him staring trance-like before the cave wall. The second figure of Bodhidharma, known as Daruma, is more humorous based on the kokeshi style. Kokeshi are handmade, hand painted Japanese wooden dolls with a simple armless, legless trunk-like body. As with the first image, Daruma Bodhidharma appears in stern concentration as he stares intently at the cave wall.

title: Stone dosojin figure
images: ["bud.stonedosojin.jpg"]
origin: Ibaraki, Japan
date: Edo Period (1603-1867)
size:
---
Dosojin or Sai No Kami are Shinto kami (spirit) figures that reside in stone markers along roads, intersections, bridges, and borders. Dosojin are considered protectors of travellers, particularly women and children. Some dosojin roadside stones bear only the name of a kami; others bear the kami in a human-like form. The dosojin displayed here is Jizo (also Gizo), one of Japan’s most popular and beloved deities, virtually equivalent to the Buddhist Avalokiteshvara. It is said Jizo hides travellers in the folds or sleeves of his ample robe. Images of Jizo first appeared in Japan around during the Nara period (710-794) and quickly became beloved as a deity of the common people. Displayed here is an 8 inch hand carved stone Jizo sculpture from the Edo Period (1603-1868) also known as the Tokugawa Period ruled by a family of feudal shoguns. During this time, the highly ordered political structure reaffirmed local Shinto and Buddhist shrine rituals and attachments. Religion likewise provided a much needed spiritual support and national identity to the emerging political order. Later, during the Meiji Period, roadside shrines were banned and many were destroyed. To protect these beloved statues, local communities often rescued them. Today, many are considered important cultural property. Displayed here is a rare example of a stone Jizo from the rural area of the northern Ibaraki Prefecture of Japan. The figure’s hands are in a gasho or prayer posture to invoke the required protection. The reverse side appears to have a kanji For the most part, roadside shrine Jizo statues were not sheltered against the elements and suffered from the effect of rain, wind, and the seasons as is evident in the example here. The natural weathering and elegant patina evidence hundreds of years as an outdoor shrine protecting the passage of many thousands of travellers and offering them a sense of comfort and security.

The pages of the book are folded in accordion style rather than the customary individual pages bound on one edge. The unique fold allows easier holding and turning of pages with one hand while the other hand is occupied ringing a bell or performing some other ritual act. Pages 1-199 may be read in one direction. Then the book is simply be turned over, unfolded in the opposite direction for the reading of pages 200-400. The book is covered front and back with a hard board jacket of gold and blue brocade silk.

title: Arhat Gobaka of the Open Heart
images: ["bud.gobakaopenheart.jpg","bud.gobakaopenheart2.jpg"]

Arhats or lohans were extraordinary disciples of the Buddha who were freed from earthly pleasures and ignorance and achieved deliverance from the cycle of birth and death. Arhats are known for their wisdom, courage and supernatural power. Because they are able to ward off evil or negativity, images of them are often found in Buddhist temples, particularly Chinese Mahayana temples. Gobaka (Man of Heart) also called Jivaka (Living Blessing) is the ninth of eighteen traditional arhats. As crown prince of a minor kingdom in India, Gobaka was first in line to inherit the throne. His younger brother began a movement contesting Gobaka’s ascension as king. Gobaka assured his brother that he would abdicate the throne and become a monk because he wanted only Buddha in his heart. As proof, Gobaka opened his garment and exposed his chest. Upon his chest was an image of the Buddha in his heart. Therefore, Gobaka is sometimes referred to as “The Heart Exposing Lohan.” The younger brother believed Gobaka and ended the revolt. Gobaka later became an arhat or enlightened Buddhist monk. Some legends say he may have been the personal physician of the Buddha.

Displayed is an unusual mechanical lotus similar to the lotus incense burners listed elsewhere in the museum. By twisting the base of the mechanism, the petals of the lotus open to reveal the Buddha sitting in the bhumisparsha (earth touching) posture. In his left hand rests in his lap holding a bowl. Some interpretations say this is a begging bowl indicating humility. It is perhaps more accurate to describe it as a medicine bowl said to cure all diseases, particularly the disease of ignorance.

Displayed are two prayer tablets or votive plaques known as ema expressing wishes, requests or thanksgiving for blessings received. The text is an artistic style of Japanese kanji hand painted with brush and ink by a Japanese scribe known as a shodoka. Such tablets are often created in honour of ancestors and placed in a shrine or temple on their behalf. For unknown reasons, the tablets displayed here are still wrapped in their original paper and were never placed in a temple.

origin: Chiba, Japan - 40km southeast of Tokyo
date: Late Edo Period (1830-1860)
size:
---
Displayed is a Japanese household altar (gohonzon – “Object of Veneration” or butsuden – “Buddha House” or kamidana – “God Shelf”) from the late Edo Period (c. 1830-60s). The outside of the altar is crafted in a rounded rectangular form with black lacquer double-hinged doors and originally would have been quite shiny. The front embellishments, latch and hinges are highly engraved, hand-worked brass. The interior of the altar is a rich gold colour. Inside the altar, sitting on a five-tiered pedestal, is a delicate and superbly carved wooden figure of Nichiren Shonin (1222-1282), founder of the Nichiren sect of Japanese Buddhism, also known as The Lotus Sect. His original name was Zennichimaro meaning Virtuous Sun Boy. After focusing on the Lotus Sutra he changed his name to “Nichiren” which translates as Sun Lotus. “Shonin” as Saint. Nichiren believed the Lotus Sutra alone brings liberation and recitation of the phrase namu myoho renge kyo (hail to the lotus sutra) is the sole path to enlightenment. He predicted natural disasters and invasions if Japan failed to turn to the Lotus Sutra. True to Nichiren’s emphasis on the Lotus Sutra, the centre of the fifth tier of the platform upon which he sits shows a small painted open lotus. The five tiers of the pedestal represent Nichiren’s five major and five minor writings on the direct way to enlightenment and the establishment of peace. Nichiren was a radical religious reformer who studied at the powerful Tendai Monastery on Mt. Hiei northeast of Kyoto. He vehemently disagreed with Pure Land Buddhist sects and proclaimed virtually all Buddhist movements, other than his own, as false religions responsible for the problems facing Japan at the time. He began his schooling at Tendai Monastery at age eleven and was ordained a monk at age sixteen. By about age thirty-one he began preaching in the streets of Kamakura, Japan, hoping to revive the purity of The Lotus Sutra. He was twice arrested as a subversive, banished, and sentenced to beheading but was later pardoned in each case. According to legend, the night before his intended execution, a brilliant light in the sky frightened off the executioners who refused to carry out the sentence. Nichiren was born February 16, 1222, into a lower class family in the remote countryside of eastern Japan. His humble and oppressed upbringing may explain his extraordinary empathy and compassion toward marginalized and exploited populations, including a revolutionary doctrinal position of non-discrimination and a complete equality (if not superiority) of women. Today, some 85% of Japan's population claim to be Buddhists, with the largest group (around 25,000,000) belonging to the Nichiren sect. Many Buddhists consider Nichiren the reincarnation of Visistacaritra, The Bodhisattva of Superior Practice, mentioned in the Lotus Sutra representative of the True Self characteristic of Buddhahood. Nichiren is also revered as The Buddha of True Cause because he revealed the cause of Buddhahood in the essence of the Lotus Sutra whereas Shakyamuni Buddha is The Buddha of True Effect as he revealed the effect of Buddhahood. Many Nichiren Buddhists regard him as the actual Buddha of this age or “The Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law.” Nichiren died October 13, 1282, after designating five senior priests and one successor. In 1358, the Japanese Imperial Court awarded Nichiren the honorific designation “Great Bodhisattva Nichiren” and in 1922 the title of “Great Teacher.” The figure’s right hand holds a removable shaku, a sceptre of authority once used by Japanese court officials. Today shaku are part of the formal attire of Japanese Shinto priests. The figure’s left hand holds a scroll of the Lotus Sutra. The back of the image reveals that originally the wooden statue was a soft blond colour, probably boxwood. It has now oxidized and become deeply blackened from more than 150 years of sitting before the smoke of daily devotional incense. When the image is removed from the altar, Nichiren’s silhouette is visible against the altar’s back wall made from incense deposits.

I am the chief monk of the Temple, and this is my office.” The sign is made from keyaki wood, a prized wood in Japan often favoured for bonsai creations and used to make temple furniture and sacred taiko drums. The back of the sign indicates the maker and a date of the late 1960s. A picture of Narita Temple is below.
