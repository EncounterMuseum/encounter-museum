Bronze scalloped oval ring once worn by an invading Crusader to restore Christian control of the Holy Land from the Muslims. Crusaders’ rings often displayed a crucifix or other Christian symbol. The top plate of this ring has been deliberately defaced with a file to remove the image. Such defacement by the Saracens (Muslims) of rings and other ornaments of captured or killed Crusaders was common. Score marks of the file are visible.

In ancient Judea, the smallest denomination of Roman copper coins were called mites. These copper coins are  mentioned in the parable of the widow’s mite (Mark 12:42-44 and Luke 21:2-4). “A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins (mites), which are worth a penny. Then he (Jesus) called his disciples and said to them, ‘Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. For all of them have contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.’” (Mark 12:42-44 NRSV)

In the year 326, Emperor Constantine sent his mother, Helena, to Jerusalem to identify objects and sites sacred to Christianity. Many of her identified sites are still visited today (e.g. Church of the Nativity, Church of the Holy Sepulchre, etc.) The most famous of her identifications are the True Cross of Jesus and other items associated with the crucifixion. Fragments of the Cross were widely distributed. St. John Chrysostom (349–407) wrote that tiny fragments of the True Cross were kept in small golden reliquaries, “which men reverently wear upon their persons.” Enclosed in the centre of this small golden reliquary are two tiny slivers of what St. Helena identified as the True Cross of Jesus. The reverse of the ornament has the crossed red threads and wax seal of Vatican authentication.

Founded in 1865 by William Booth and his wife Catherine in London, UK, the Salvation Army is know for its social ministry to the homeless, destitute, addicts, alcoholics, and victims of various natural disasters. It is also known for its singing of Christmas carols and other hymns on street corners. One of the primary instruments of the Salvation Army Band is the timbrel or tambourine. The crest and ribbons on the timbrel signifies the following:

The Cross is the Cross of Jesus

The "S" is for salvation

The swords represent spiritual warfare

The rays on the outside of the circle is the fire of the Holy Spirit

The starry jewelled crown is God’s glory

The words “Blood and Fire” recall the blood of Jesus and the fire of the Holy Spirit

The dots are the truth of the Gospel (number of dots not important and may vary)

The blue, red, and yellow ribbons are the Trinity (Father, Son and Spirit respectively).

The Celtic Cross is a symbol the combines a Cross with a circle at the intersection of the arms. Usually some interlacing design or spirals are part of the Cross’s decoration. The Crosses are particularly found in Ireland and British Isles. The tradition of erecting Celtic Crosses was especially popular in the 700s. Some legends claim Celtic Crosses were introduced by St. Patrick.

Displayed here is small, plastic representation of a Catholic altar similar to the appearance altars prior to the Second Vatican Council when the priest officiated with his back to the congregation and faced the altar with them. After Vatican II the priest stood behind the altar facing the congregation. This small altar shows God the Father at the top. Behind his head is a triangle for the Trinity. God’s right hand is raised in blessing. His left hand holds a orb, symbol of universal power. Along the top are depictions of four saints. Below God the Father is the crucified Christ. Flanking the crucifix are the archangels Michael and Gabriel. Below the crucifix is a small tabernacle with a door that opens in which may be placed a small chalice. Below the altar table is a relief of the Last Supper. Two candles sit in front.

St. Anne was the mother of St. Mary, the mother of Jesus. Mary’s father was St. Joachim. Although there is no evidence that Mary could read, she is often shown holding a book to symbolize that she was an intelligent woman. Many people mistakenly think the Immaculate Conception has to do with Mary’s conception of Jesus. Actually the doctrine of Immaculate Conception, which was formalized as Catholic doctrine in 1858 by Pope Pius IX, has to do with Anne’s conception of Mary. Because Mary was conceived immaculately, Jesus was born without sin, thus breaking the Christian notion of the succession of Original Sin. In Christian belief, therefore, the Immaculate Conception of Anne with Mary made sinless Jesus worthy to bring out the redemption of sinful humanity.

Though there is no evidence, a popular legend suggests that the “lost years” of Jesus not accounted for in the Bible were spent in India learning spiritual insights from Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists which he later taught in Judea. The image of the Yogic Christ calls to mind that legend. Jesus is shown sitting in the lotus position surrounded by peaceable animals: snow leopard, bunny, dove, cardinal, small lizards at his elbow and waist, and even a serpent at his feet.

title: Septuaginta
images: ["chr.septuagint.jpg","chr.septuagint2.jpg"]

Septuagint literally means 70 and, therefore, is sometimes simply referred to as LXX. The title refers to the legend that 70 (or 72) scholars were asked by King Ptolemy II of Egypt in the third century bce to translate the Torah into Greek. Working in separate rooms for 72 days, each scholar produced identical translations, considered to be proof of divine guidance and veracity of their work. Displayed here are two volumes of the 1943 printing edited by Alfred Rahlfs (1865-1935). The title reads: Septuaginta: Id Est Vetus Testamentum Graece Iuxta LXX Interpretes  meaning “Septuagint: This is the Old Testament in Greek According to Seventy Translators”.

title: Chinese Jesus
images: ["chr.chinesejesus.jpg"]
origin: Chinatown, Toronto, Canada
size:

Displayed here is a wooden hand carved image of Jesus purchased in Toronto’s China Town. What is unique about this piece is Jesus’ distinctive Chinese features. Jesus’ right hand is in the traditional Christian symbol of blessing by a priest: thumb, index finger and third finger raised representing the Trinity; the small and ring fingers down representing the two nature of Christ (human and divine). On the heart of Jesus are five dots, perhaps representing the five wounds of Christ (hands, feet, side) or the traditional five Chinese blessings (longevity, riches, health, virtue, and natural death). Jesus’ robes are gold and burgundy, traditional colours of Buddhist monks’ robes. In Buddhism, gold represents wisdom; burgundy represents compassion. The pedestal upon which Jesus stands shows stylized pine trees as traditionally portrayed in Chinese art. Because pine trees continue through both favourable and austere weather conditions and seasons, they are often associated in Chinese art with longevity (eternal life) and sages and great teachers whose discipline and perseverance transcend all circumstance.

The 2.5 X 4.5 inch plaque displayed here is known as The Virgin in Glory. Mary holds the child Jesus in the curve of her left arm while above an angel reaches from heaven with the crown of Mary’s coronation as Queen of Heaven. Candle bearing angels flank each side of the scene. The figures stand beneath a trefoil arch symbolic of the Trinity. The original, probably from France (circa 1350-80), is ivory and is part of a hinged diptych (two panel picture). The second panel is the crucifixion. The artist makes liberal use of curves (turn of the head, arms, wrist, hips, legs, folds of the robes) giving the scene extraordinary fluidity and grace. The faux ivory reproduction shown was purchased at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, in 2004.

St. Bruno (1032-1101) was the founder of the Carthusian Order, an extremely cloistered Order of Catholic monks. St. Bruno’s famous statement was “God and God alone in solitude.” Beneath the quotation on the picture displayed here is a symbol of the three pillars of Western Christian monasticism:

Ora – Prayer represented by the kneeling monk. As far as possible, Carthusian monks have no contact with the outside world. Their contribution to the world is a life of prayer on behalf of humanity and the Church.

Labour – Physical, manual work represented by the sheaf of grain.

Lectio Divina – Sacred reading and study represented by the stack of books.

The Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) has its world headquarters in Independence, Missouri, USA. The Temple constructed during the first half of the 1990s is a worship, education, and office building “dedicated to the pursuit of peace” and is open to the public. The building’s design was inspired by the shape of a nautilus shell. The outer stone walls of the Temple are pink and gray granite. Displayed here are two sample stones given to Encounter during the construction of the Temple.

The word Pantocrator is Greek for Almighty taken from Revelation 1:8 of the Christian scriptures: “‘I am the Alpha and the Omega,’ says the Lord God, ‘who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.’” Images known as The Pantocrator is a particular depiction of Jesus as rendered by Eastern Orthodox Christian artists. Among the characteristics of most Pantocrator images are the following:

The Greek letter IC and XC on either side of Jesus’ head. The letters are abbreviations the words Jesus and Christ. Small wavy lines above the letters is a convention meaning “abbreviation.”

Either side of Jesus is Pantocrator. “PANTO” at the right shoulder. “CRATOR” at the left shoulder.

Stylized halo containing a Cross with the Greek letters meaning “Self-existent” in the arms of the Cross.

A solemn face indicating the serious nature of the image.

Non-photographic representation indicating what is seen is spiritual, not physical.

Jesus holds a book, either opened or closed, indicating the new law and teaching.

Jesus’ hand is raised in a unique posture of blessing that spells the letter IC XC.

Reverse perspective – objects such as the book are narrower in the front and wider in the back – making the vanishing point in the eye of the viewer.

Symbolic colour of Jesus’ red tunic and blue cloak: red indicates divinity or spirit was closest to Jesus’ nature; blue indicates he took upon him the role or flesh of humanity.

The San Damiano Cross is reportedly the Cross that spoke to St. Francis of Assisi that began his mission. Among the distinctive features of the San Damiano Cross are the following:

Jesus, though crucified, is shown strong rather than suffering as in many crucifix designs.

Under Jesus’ arms are disciples – Mary and John on the right, the other women and disciples on the left.

Angels respond to Jesus’ wounded hands.

Above Jesus’ head, he is seen entering the orb of heaven welcomed by angels and God the Father represented by the hand of blessing reaching out from the celestial realm.

The original Cross hangs in the Basilica of Saint Clare in Assisi, Italy.

Triptych literally means three-fold. A triptych piece of art is one that opens into three panels. The miniature triptych displayed here is of The Deisis meaning The Prayer. The centre of all Deisis illustrations is Jesus, shown here as The Pantocrator (see cf.) To the right of Jesus in all Deisis illustrations is his mother, Mary. Above Mary’s head are letters representing the Greek abbreviation for Theotokos or Mother of God. The figure on the left of Jesus may vary among Deisis illustrations. Most popular, as is the case here, is John the Baptist. The triptych is shown both open and closed.

title: Holy water fonts

size:
---
A holy water font or stoup is a small basin containing holy water at the sanctuary entrance of some Christian churches. With the exception of some Anglican and Orthodox churches, Protestant Christians (non-Catholic) generally do not use holy water fonts. The water is made “holy” by a pronounced blessing of a priest. Practitioners usually dip the index and third fingers in the water and make the sign of the Cross on their bodies (head, chest, shoulders). Holy water and sign of the Cross when entering a church recalls baptism, cleanses certain sins, and provides protection. Displayed here are three stoup or holy water fonts. All three show evidence of considerable use.

Stoup #1. The first and oldest is a free standing stoup with a crucifix flanked by candles. At the top of the Cross is a banner with the letters INRI, an acronym representing the Latin inscription IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDÆORVM (Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum) “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.” The water receptacle sits beneath the Cross in the shape of a shell. The front of the base shows three Christian symbols – Cross (Faith), Anchor (Hope), Heart (Love). The base’s right side shows the Cross of Jesus with a crown of thorns. The base’s left side shows a vase containing the waters of life. On the back of the base is the Sacred Heart of Jesus shining light and aflame with compassion.

Stoup #2. The second stoup displayed is a ceramic wall mount font from Ireland in the shape of a Celtic Cross. On the Cross are thirteen figures, the number of people at the Last Supper. The bowl of the font shows a Cross surrounded with Celtic knots representing Eternal Life.

Stoup #3. The third stoup made of brass is also a wall mount. On the fount are two angels kneeling in adoration and grief before the crucified Jesus. At the top of the Cross is a banner with the letters INRI, an acronym representing the Latin inscription IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDÆORVM (Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum) “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.”

Viaticum is a term used by the Roman Catholic Church for administering the Eucharist (Communion or Last Supper) to a person who is dying. Originally the Latin word viaticum referred to provisions for travelling (via=way). Therefore, the Catholic rite of Viaticum literally provides for the passage of the dying from life on earth to life in heaven. The Viaticum set includes:

Crucifix – Affixed to the inside lid of the opened altar. By a simple spring device, the crucifix may be removed to hand to the dying person.

Candles – Made of beeswax and inserted into holders permanently affixed to the base of the altar providing a suitable glow to the scene.

Holy Water Bottle – With the words “Holy Water” on one side and a Cross and Crown on the other side.

Stoup – Or holy water font beneath the crucifix in the shape of a shell.

Aspergillum – Or holy water sprinkler brush for used by the priest for sprinkling the room, patient and others.

Sacramental Cloths – In pockets on each side of the crucifix. One is for the chest of the communicant and one for the fingers of the priest.

Absorbent Cotton – Used after anointing the sick to absorb oil from the priest’s fingers.

Ablution Cup – Used by the priest to wash his fingers before and after contact with the Sacred Host (bread or wafer). The original cup would have been made of aluminum. The cup in this set is obviously not original. It appears that many years ago someone painted a glass votive candle holder silver as a replacement.

Spoon – Used by the priest to give a little water to the communicant after receiving the Host (wafer). According to the contents list, the spoon has a Cross on it. Because this one does not, it is an obvious replacement made some years ago.

Two Plates – One is for used absorbent cotton. The other plate holds the ablution cup. Each plate has the letters ihs. Interpretations differ as to the exact meaning of these three letter known as a christogram. One interpretation is the first three letters of the Greek word for Jesus – IHSOUS (ΙΗΣΟΥΣ). Another interpretation is the first letters of the Latin phrase Iesus Hominum Salvator (Jesus Humanity’s Saviour).

Instruction Pamphlets – Two instruction pamphlets are in the pockets on each side of the crucifix behind the Sacramental Cloths. One is titled: “The Last Rites of the Church.” The other is titled: “How to Assist the Sick and Dying.”

The 1912 portable Viaticum altar shown here is in a handmade oak case. On top is a brass Cross. The corners of the case are finely dovetailed. When opened the case creates an altar. Compartments and fasteners keep the items in place when the case is closed for transporting. Although there is no document verification, stories surrounding this Viaticum altar claim it was used for service men in World Wars I and II.

Date: 1912

Orthodox Christianity generally uses olive oil lamps to illumine icons rather than electric lamps. These lamps may be called sanctuary lamps, icon lamps or vigil lamps and may be either hanging or standing. Hanging lamps have three chains and standing lamps have three legs. The number three is symbolic of the Trinity. Reservoir three-fourths filled with water and one-fourth with olive oil. The oil floats on the water and a wicked cork is floated on the oil. Orthodox Christianity uses only pure olive oil because of its symbolism and association with the Christian scripture. Oil flames give a softer, more golden, unflickering, steady glow than candle flames. Standing vigil lamps are particularly popular for use with home icons. Hanging vigil lamps are more popular to light icons in churches.

A simple device employed by many religions using oil lamps. A beeswax wick is placed in a cork float. A lamp or bowl is filled approximately ¾  full of water. The remaining ¼ is filled with olive oil or vegetable oil which floats on the water. The cork then floats on the oil with half the wick below the cork in the oil and the top half of the wick above the oil for lighting. Floating wicks are particularly popular in Orthodox Christianity and Buddhism. Orthodox Christianity uses only pure olive oil because of its symbolism and association with the Christian scripture. Buddhism may use olive oil, corn oil, canola or other vegetable oils. Oil flames give a softer, more golden, unflickering steady glow than candle flames.
