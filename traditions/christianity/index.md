# Christianity

Christianity is a Western tradition descended from [Judaism]({{ site.url }}/traditions/judaism) and related to [Islam]({{ site.url }}/traditions/islam).

It was founded in approximately 32 CE by Jesus Christ, a Jewish man from Nazareth in Galilee who became an itinerant preacher, and gathered many followers during his life. He was sentenced to death by crucifixion in approximately 33 AD by the Roman authorities, based on condemnation from Jewish leaders.

Today, Christianity is a large global religion with many different denominations covering a wide spectrum of beliefs, cultures, and attitudes toward Christ, God and the believer.
