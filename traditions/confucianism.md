Confucianism is less a religion and more an ethical, social, political, and philosophical system based on the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Master Kong or Kong Fuzi (551â€“479 BCE), translated in English as Confucius. Its focus is on this-world human potential and relationships rather than deity, divine law and the afterlife. Confucian influence has extended to places like Korea, Japan and Vietnam and has been a powerful force in China for over two millennia, recently regaining status after decades of Communist suppression eased.

One of the symbols for Confucianism is the Chinese ideogram for water. The metaphoric meaning of water is a fitting representation for Confucian philosophy. Water is humble, pure, in balance and harmony with its environment, non-forcing, and natural. The Chinese ideogram for water displayed here is a polished engraving in black granite.

The Chinese ideogram shuangxi  often translates as Double Happiness or Double Joy. Because the shuangxi represents endless prosperity, it is often used as decoration for Chinese New Year, weddings or other celebrations. Occasionally it is used as a symbol for Confucianism representing two stylized humans in a state of balance and harmony producing happiness and joy.
