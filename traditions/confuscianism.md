One of the symbols for Confucianism is the Chinese ideogram for water. The metaphoric meaning of water is a fitting representation for Confucian philosophy. Water is humble, pure, in balance and harmony with its environment, non-forcing, and natural. The Chinese ideogram for water displayed here is a polished engraving in black granite.

The Chinese ideogram shuangxi  often translates as Double Happiness or Double Joy. Because the shuangxi represents endless prosperity, it is often used as decoration for Chinese New Year, weddings or other celebrations. Occasionally it is used as a symbol for Confucianism representing two stylized humans in a state of balance and harmony producing happiness and joy.
