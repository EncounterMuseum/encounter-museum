size:

On this handwritten scroll in the style of the Chinese shodokas or calligraphers, a brush is dipped in ink and the letters drawn. The large letter in the centre 道  is the word DAO. The smaller letters underneath spell out the opening line of the Daoist scripture, the Daode Jing. Reading from right to left and up to down, the passage says: “The Dao that can me spoken…is not the Eternal Dao…The name that can’t be named…is not the Eternal Name…Only the Unnameable is the Eternally Real. The red seals indentify the shodoka (calligrapher).

Laozi (also Lao Tzu) is a Chinese philosopher whose ideas became known as Daoism (also Taoism). He is shown here in his last known sighting at Hangu Pass as he rode off on a water buffalo after purportedly writing down his insights known as the Daode Jing (Dao De Ching). Exhibit one is terracotta showing Laozi holding a book, presumably the Daode Jing. Exhibit two is hand carved wood; Laozi is holding a bamboo staff in his right hand and a peach (symbol of life) in his left hand. On each knee and shoulder is a trigram pattern from the Daoist Yi Jing (Book of Changes). The back of Laozi’s cloak displays the taijitu or yin yang symbol of Daoism.

Displayed us an oil painting of a Procession of Daoist Priests commemorating a sermon of the Buddha known as the Flower Sermon. Buddha simply lifted a flower in silence. Only one disciple understood the implication that enlightenment is an experience, not a teaching. The priest in the foreground lifts a yellow flower in his right hand. Yellow is a symbol of wisdom. The blue umbrella in the background is a symbol of reverence and is most likely lifted above an unseen image of the Buddha. This is an original oil painting by Larry Wilkinson. Donated to the Encounter World Religions Museum by the artist.

The Chinese figures displayed here represent the three universal aspirations: Shou (Longevity), Lu (Prosperity), Fu (Good Fortune). They are generally arranged left to right as in the photo. Shou with the staff and peach is on the far left. Lu holding a ruyi (cf. ruyi) is in the middle. Fu with a fan is on the far right.

Although at first glance the object displayed here may be mistaken for a large egg, it is actually a peach. The peach is one of the most important symbolic fruits in Chinese and Daoist mythology as a symbol of long life. Hand painted on the peach is an old Daoist sage/deity Jurojin (also known as Gama), one of the Shichifukujin or Seven Gods of Fortune. He is the god of wisdom and longevity. He walks with a staff upon which is written the lifespan of all living beings. Jurojin is often shown with a deer, a long-lived animal associated with longevity. The deer is Jurojin’s companion and messenger. Jurojin may also be seen carrying a fan and in the company of a crane.
