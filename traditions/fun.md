In Zen Buddhism, a koan is a story, question, or statement that defies a logical response. The purpose is to move the individual past linear thinking to intuitive reflection. One often quoted koan is “What is the sound of one hand clapping?” Another well known koan is “Does a dog have Buddha nature?” It is this koan that the meditating dog figure suggests.

Perhaps the best known poem of the American poet William Carlos Williams is “The Red Wheelbarrow.” Among other meanings, the poem speaks of the imperative of recognizing extraordinary elegance and beauty in the simplicity of everyday life. “So much depends” on the ability to do just that. The poem says:



so much depends*upon



a red wheel*barrow



glazed with rain*water



beside the white*chickens.

Quasimodo is a fictional character from Victor Hugo’s novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The word means “almost like” or “partly made.” It was a name given to a hunchback stone carver who lived in the bell tower of Notre Dame Cathedral because he was considered less than (almost or partly) in the mode or form of a human. Because in the novel Quasimodo’s imperfections as well as passions – especially for the character of the beautiful Esmeralda – are visible for all to see, he is a symbol of rebellion against shallowness, superficiality, and self-centeredness personified by the handsome Captain Phoebus. The small image of Quasimodo displayed here was purchased at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, in 2004.

Elton Trueblood (1900-1994) was a noted American Quaker author, theologian, and chaplain at Harvard and Stanford universities. In a media interview near the end of his life, Trueblood was asked how he would summarize his long career. After a moment’s thought he replied, “and.” When asked to clarify, he explained that life is a series of events, thoughts, understandings, and acts that move us along a series of situations and circumstances toward its eventual end. Sometimes one thinks a particular way, does a particular thing…and…then one thinks a new way and does a new thing. Therefore, Trueblood explained, life is this …and… that …and… something else. Life may be described as “…and…” The small wooded “…and…” displayed here was a gift created especially for Encounter inspired by Elton Trueblood’s portrayal of life.

title: answers jar

Displayed is a small jar labelled “Answers.” It’s empty. Some view the jar and lament at its emptiness. Others celebrate that certainty is not absolute. What’s your opinion? Do you prefer the answers or the questions? In pondering your view, consider some thought from a few others.



I have found a fullness in the doubts and questions of my life that I once thought could only be found in the answers. Mercifully, doubts and questions have come to be so fulfilling that I find myself suspicious of answers, not because they are necessarily false or irrelevant, but because even when relevant and true they are, and can only be, partial. It is doubt and questioning that always lure me on to broader horizons and deeper insights through an openness to the infinite that leaves me contentedly discontent. (Darrell J. Fasching, Narrative Theology After Auschwitz: From Alienation To Ethics, Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1992, p.4)



It is right for you to experience doubt and perplexity. Do not allow yourselves to be guided by relationships, traditions or what you have heard said. Do not allow yourselves to be guided by the authority of religious texts or by simple logic. When you know for yourself that certain things are unfavourable, false or bad, then renounce them. When you know for yourself that certain things are favourable and good, then accept them and follow them. Believe nothing no matter where you read it or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense. (Buddha – Sutta Pitaka)



We are not allowed the luxury of certainty, but only the pain of ambiguity that is the lot of all learners as they move from one point of secure knowledge to another. (Luke Timothy Johnson, professor at Candler School of Theology)



People have a faith. If they say, “This is my faith,” so far they maintain truth. But by that they cannot proceed to the absolute conclusion: “This alone is Truth, and everything else is false.” (Majjhima Nikaya ii.176, Canki Sutta)



After the Holocaust, there should be no final solutions, not even theological ones. No statement, theological or otherwise, should be made that would not be credible in the presence of burning children. (Rabbi Irving Greenburg from: Eva Fleischner, ed., Auschwitz” Beginning of a New Era?,  Rabbi Irving Greenburg, “Cloud of Smoke,. Pillar of Fire: Judaism, Christianity, and Modernity after the Holocaust,” KTAV Publishing House, Inc.: New York, 1977, pp. 26, 23.)



The mice think they are right, but my cat eats them anyway. This is the point…reality is nothing, perception is everything. (Terry Goodkind, novelist)



Re-examine all that you have been told. Dismiss that which insults your soul. (Walt Whitman, poet)



Proliferating systems of ritual and philosophy attempt to throw dust into the eyes of the eternal wisdom that abides in every soul. But when relative existence is revealed there are no teachers and nothing to teach, no students and nothing to learn. My delusion is gone, gone, utterly gone! Who can obscure truth? Who can keep a blazing fire tied in a cotton cloth? (Ramprasad, The Essential Mystics, Andrew Harvey, ed. pp. 48, 49)



A donkey with a load of holy books is still a donkey. (Sufi Proverb)



Four (Other) Noble Truths: I do not know. I will not know. I can not know. I must not know. (JW Windland)

title: thunder maker
images: ["fun.thundermaker.jpg"]

Displayed here is a small “thunder maker” toy. Holding the toy so the spring hangs beneath the tube then shaking the tube gently produces a sound like thunder as the timbre of the moving spring reverberates in the hollow tube. The thunder-like sound of the toy reminds one of the famous passage from Hinduism’s Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in which thunder, as the voice of the Ultimate, spoke to each of the three realms telling them exactly what they need to hear. Each realm interpreted the roll of thunder as one of the three cardinal virtues of Hinduism sometimes referred to as The Three Das because each begins with the syllable “da”: Damyata (self-control), Datta (generosity), and Dayadhvam (mercy). These virtues are the foundation of Hindu ethical thought and reflection spoken and enacted at the very beginning of time. When one hears thunder, it is the Divine Voice saying, “Da,” and admonishing the practice of these three virtues. Part V of T. S. Eliot’s poem The Wasteland  titled “What The Thunder Said” is based on the celebrated scripture passage. Following is a retelling of the story of “The Three  Das” or “The Voice of the Thunder” from the Second Brahmana of the Khila Kanda of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.

The threefold offspring of Prajapati – gods, humans, and demons – dwelt with their teacher-sage, Prajapati, as students of sacred knowledge.

Having lived the life of a student of sacred knowledge, the gods said, “Speak to us.” To them Prajapati spoke this syllable: “Da. Do you understand?” the sage asked. “We do understand,” they said. “You said to us, ‘Damyata – control yourselves.’” “Yes!” Prajapati said. “You do understand.”

So then the humans said, “Speak to us.” To them Prajapati spoke this syllable: “Da. Do you understand?” the sage asked. “We do understand,” they said. “You said to us, ‘Datta  – be generous.’” “Yes!” Prajapati said. “You do understand.”

So then the demons said, “Speak to us.” To them Prajapati spoke this syllable: “Da. Do you understand?” the sage asked. “We do understand,” they said. “You said to us, ‘Dayadhvam – be merciful.’” “Yes!” Prajapati said. “You do understand.”

This same thing does the Divine Voice of thunder, repeat: Da! Da! Da! That is, control yourselves, be generous, be merciful. One should practice this same triad: self-control, generosity, mercy.
