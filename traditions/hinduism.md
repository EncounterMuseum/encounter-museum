Hinduism is the major religion of India with over a billion adherents worldwide. Many scholars consider Hinduism the world’s oldest continuously observed religion with a broad spectrum of religious expressions. Because it is a type of ancient native spirituality, it is without a founder or beginning date. Hinduism claims a path to overcoming ego, merging with the Oneness of divine reality, and being released from the cycle of birth and death.

Banalinga are rare stones found only in one location in the world along the Narmada River in India. Because they exist naturally and are not created by human hands, they are considered self-manifesting forms of Lord Shiva and are also known as Svayambhu Linga meaning “the self-existent mark.” According to Hindu scripture, worship of the banalinga does not require the usual installation ritual performed for all other murtis (divine forms) because the divine is naturally present.

Her kilt is made of severed hands, symbolic of severing desire and grasping. Despite her fierce appearance, many images (such as the small black one displayed here) show Kali lifting her upper right hand in the fear dispelling posture and the lower right hand in the gesture of boon bestowing.

From ancient times the Jagannatha deities were pulled in chariots in an annual excursion through the city of Puri, Orissa, India. The great effort required to pull the Jagannatha chariots is the origin of the word juggernaut meaning a tremendous force, campaign, or movement.

These four Hindu deities displayed here are often seen as a group. Lord Rama, in the middle, is the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu, and is the model of an ideal man and husband who followed his destiny despite hardship. Rama is often shown as blue (as are Krishna and Vishnu) representing the vastness of his nature as the vastness of the blue sky and blue ocean. His right hand is generally lifted in the abhaya (fear dispelling) mudra. Always to Rama’s right is his brother, Lakshmana, the model of the ideal brother. Rama and Lakshmana are easily identified among Hindu deities by their bows and quiver of arrows. Always to Rama’s left is his wife, Sita, the ideal model of a faithful wife. Bowing before the three is the monkey god, Hanuman (an avatar of Lord Shiva), the ideal model of selfless service. These four figures are the prime characters is the story of the Ramayana, a Hindu scripture telling of the kidnapping of Sita by the demon Ravana and her rescue in Sri Lanka by Rama and Lakshmana assisted by the devoted Hanuman.

Ganesh or Ganesha is an elephant-headed deity and one of the most beloved of Hinduism. Among many other attributes, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles. As such, he is invoked to bless all beginnings. In this hand painted, hand carved marble image, he lifts the front right hand in the abhaya (fear dispelling) mudra. The back right hand holds an axe that cuts away the ego and attachments that bind us. His front left hand and his trunk hold laddoo or modaka, a traditional Indian sweet to attract devotees to him. It symbolizes the pure joy of fulfillment. The back left hand holds a pasha rope that binds us to him and our true nature and leads us along the path of Truth. He is wearing a regal crown, yellow shalwar (pants), beaded necklace and a garland of golden bilva leaves, a tree sacred to Lord Shiva. Every Hindu deity has an animal upon which it rides called a vahana (from which derives the English word vehicle). Ganesh chose a humble mouse named Mushika who is almost always shown in depictions of Ganesh. In this image Mushika hides in the lower right corner. One of the many symbolisms of Mushika is that, like God’s grace, a mouse is often unseen but always at work. The image is displayed on a decorative eight-pointed dais.

A type of “Holy Family” in Hinduism is the three figures of Lord Shiva, Mother Parvati and Lord Ganesh. Shiva, meaning auspicious one, is a major deity of Hinduism and is the Lord of transformation. Parvat, from which comes the name Parvati, means mountain. She is the daughter of the heavenly nymph Mena and King Himavat, personification of the Himalaya mountains. Her sister, also daughter of Himavat is the Goddess Ganga (Ganges River). Ganesh is the son of Shiva and Parvati. The unique depiction of the three displayed here represents their oneness by the sharing of the same face among them. The animals in the picture are the vahanas (animal vehicles) upon which the three ride: Nandi, the cosmic bull, for Lord Shiva; Manashtala, the subdued lion or sometimes tiger for Mother Parvati; and Mushika, the humble mouse, for Lord Ganesh. Next to Lord Shiva are objects associated with him: the shivalinga, trident, dhamaru (small drum), and cobra. Water springs from Shiva’s head that became the Ganges. Ganesh holds a kalasha or sacred water pot of holy nectar in his truck. In front of Ganesh is a red flower particularly favoured by Ganesh – red is his favourite colour. In the background are the Himalaya mountains associated with Parvati because her father is Lord Himavat of the mountains. This picture was given to Encounter as a Diwali gift from a Hindu supporter.

Because Ganesh is lord of journeys, pathways, beginnings, and thresholds, images of him are often found at doorways of Hindu homes. The image of Lord Ganesh displayed here likely came from the entrance of a small temple because it has a receptacle for kumkum, a powder that is applied to the forehead as a sign of devotion when visiting a temple or performing Hindu worship call puja. Kumkum may be of various colours, but red is most common in temples. Red is also said to be the favoured colour of Ganesh. This Ganesh threshold kumkum holder is heavily tinted from the use and application of red kumkum.

Rudraksha is a seed from a broadleaf evergreen tree that grows in the foothills of the Himalaya mountains. The seeds are often used to make Hindu japa mala (prayer beads). Rudraksha seeds with five grooves are favoured because they represent the five mantras or forms of God (sometimes called faces) that make up the body of Lord Shiva and are associated with the five elements, the five senses, the five organs of perception, and the five organs of action. Another name for Shiva is Rudra. In Sanskrit, aksha means “eyes.” According to legend, when Shiva emerged from an intense meditation, from his eye fell a tear shed in compassion for suffering humanity. From that tear grew the first rudraksha tree. Because of the connection with Lord Shiva, rudraksha japa mala are said to be a favourite of Lord Ganesh, son of Shiva.

His mission was to teach others the way to achieve the nature of Krishna Consciousness. He popularized the well-known Hare Krishna chant and taught that moksha or liberation is realized through devotion to God, particularly Lord Krishna and not determined by caste or gender. Approximately 430 years after Chaitanya’s death, a devotee of the movement, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabuhupada (1896-1977), arrived in New York City in 1966 and founded the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) sometimes called Hare Krishna because of the repeated use of the Hare Krishna chant.

origin: India
date: Modern

Tiruvadi or charan paduka are hand carved sacred sandals worn by saints, sages and gurus. They symbolize the sacred feet of the divine and the holy feet of the wearer. The word paduka means footprint. Because the wooden soles do not flex when walking, a particular pressure and clinching of the foot and toes are required to keep the sandals on. Reportedly, the pressure of the post between the toes activates a specific nerve that aids in mental and spiritual consciousness. According to the Hindu scripture Ramayana, Lord Ram blessed his brother Bharata with his charan paduka sandals as a remembrance of him during his 14 years of exile. Some Hindus may place a pair of padukas on their home altar as an object of veneration symbolic of the presence of the divine. The pair of charan padukas shown here are hand carved from teak, indicating a wearer of high status (particularly spiritual status). Paduka may also be made of sandalwood, ebony, ivory, silver, brass, or other metal.

Kuthuvilakku are standing oil lamps used in Hinduism. The light of the lamps symbolize the dispelling of ignorance and awakening of the divine light. Ghee (clarified butter) or vegetable oil is placed in the top reservoir. Small cotton wicks sit in the ghee and extend slightly over each spout. A lamp with five wicks is called a niranjan meaning without sorrow. As the wicks burn, the soft glow illumines the temple or shrine room adding to the serene atmosphere of the sacred space. Some say the oil represents vices and the wicks represent ego. As both are ignited by divine fire both eventually perish. A bird-like figure is a common image on kuthuvilakku. Although they look like peacocks they are in fact celestial white birds called Annam birds that are so pure that when given a water and milk mixture, they can separate the two and drink only the milk. The kuthuvilakku lamps displayed here are handmade from India.

Purna-Kalasha is a small metal pot of pure water with a husked coconut in the opening encircled by 5, 7, or 11 mango leaves. The rounded pot represents the womb of the universe as the giver of life. A sacred thread (puja string) may be tied around the mouth of the pot indicating auspiciousness. The water in the pot represents the life-giving force. Breaking a coconut before Ganesh’s shrine is symbolic of the shattering of the hard, unattractive ego to reveal the sweet fruit inside. It is a symbol of abundant life and wisdom. Mangos are associated with the attainment of perfection. The prime number of mango leaves (5, 7, or 11) represents the indivisibility of the Sacred. A pot decorated in this way is called a purna-kalasha or purna-kumbha meaning complete offering. Purna=full; kumbha or kalasha=pitcher. The purna-kalasha is offered to god – particularly Lord Ganesh – during a Hindu puja or worship ceremony. Some purna-kalasha use actual coconuts and leaves. In order to last, the kalasha displayed in the Encounter museum is copper.

Vishnu supports his head with his lower right hand while his upper right hand holds the disc of the purified mind. His upper left hand holds the conch sell of transformation while his lower left hand holds a baton of authority. The lotus of the universe springs from his navel on which sits Lord Brahma who from this position creates the worlds. Brahma opens his eyes, and a world comes into being. Brahma closes his eyes, and a world goes out of being. The life of a Brahma is 432,000 years. The lotus goes back, and a new lotus is formed with its own Brahma. The image of Lord Brahma holds his traditional symbols of book, water pot, prayer beads, and lotus. At Vishnu’s feet is his wife, Laxmi, the goddess of physical and spiritual wealth. The image displayed here is reproduced from the central portico of the Prasat Phnom Rung Temple, Thailand from the mid 1100s. The original was once smuggled out of the country and discovered in a Chicago museum. It has since been returned to the Thai people.

The Shivalinga is an ancient symbol of Lord Shiva. Some scholars suggest the Shivalinga and associated rituals are the world’s oldest continuous form of worship in existence. The standing stone of the lingam (male) together with the round yoni stone (female) is a symbol of ultimate creative, regenerative power – both physical and spiritual. The shape of the Shivalinga allows water, milk and other libations to drain off as they are poured over the top in a ritual act called abhishekam. Other offerings include honey, yogurt, sandalwood paste, ghee (clarified butter), rosewater, and even money. The most common libation offering is a mixture of milk and water. To perform the ritual, one holds a kumbha (ritual pot) of the libation in the right hand. The left hand supports the extended right arm. As the liquid is poured over the lingam stone, the worshiper repeats the five syllable mantra “Om Namah Shivaya” (pronounced om-nam-ha-shiv-ya) meaning “I bow to the name of Lord Shiva.”

Ganesh or Ganesha is an elephant-headed deity and one of the most beloved of Hinduism. Among many other attributes, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles. As such, he is invoked to bless all beginnings, journeys, thresholds, and new endeavours. Therefore, images of him are often found at doorways of Hindu homes. The usual location of the hand carved wooden image of Lord Ganesh displayed here is over the door of the Encounter Museum. Ganesha’s back right hand holds an ankusha or sharp goad to clear the path before us and to spur on reluctant souls. His front right hand holds his tusk that has been broken for a pen he used to write the Mahabharata. Notice that Ganesh’s right tusk is smaller than the left. Consequently, Ganesh is sometimes called Ekadanta (One Tusk). His front left hand holds laddoo or modaka, a traditional Indian sweet to attract devotees to him. It symbolizes the pure joy of fulfillment. The back left hand holds a pasha rope that binds us to him and our true nature and leads us along the path of Truth. Notice that the top of the image has the figure of Kirtimukha or Face of Glory described elsewhere in the museum.

Dipa (also deepa, diva, diya, deepak, deepam) are lamps used in Hinduism and lighted with oil or ghee (clarified butter). Because they are so inexpensive, clay dipas are particularly popular when lamps are needed in large numbers in temples, for religious celebrations or Diwali, the Festival of Lights. The small clay lamps displayed here are all handmade.

Kumkum is a powder that is applied to the forehead as a sign of devotion when visiting a temple. Kumkum may be of various colours, but red is most common in temples. Red kumkum, called sindoor in Hindi, is also applied to the front parting of the hair by women as a sign of marriage. Red kumkum is made of dried, powdered turmeric mixed with calcium hydroxide, also known as slaked lime, which turns the yellow turmeric a bright red. Kumkum is also widely used for honouring Hindu goddess figures. Kumkum powder and other brightly coloured powders are thrown into the air during the popular spring Hindu festival of Holi (the Festival of Colours). Displayed here is a small box of red kumkum.

Incense or dhoop is popular in the worship practices of many religions, particularly those originating in India. Use of incense, particularly in more ancient times, served both practical and spiritual of functions. Burning incense is believed to provide symbolic as well as actual purification. It is a symbol of self sacrifice. The pleasant aroma masks more unpleasant odours and chases away flying insects. Finally, burning incense is a way to signify meditation times and lengths determined by the time it took for a particular length of incense to burn. Dhoop

title: om

size:

The symbol om or aum () represents the primordial sound from which all things emerged and is the most sacred sound, the most sacred word, the most sacred syllable, the most sacred symbol, the most sacred prayer in the Hindu religion. Past, present and future are all contained in the sound. It appears in other religions of Indian origin as well (Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism). *Chanting om is said to enable an individual to undergo a transformation of consciousness that all allows a returning to one’s centre, a freeing from internal discord, a moving toward primal and cosmic harmony, and an attuning to the oneness of all. Om is sometimes called the four syllable sound. Each syllable is metaphorical of a state of spiritual consciousness and its field of experience.

The first syllable “A” represents waking consciousness. This is the state of everyday life.

The second syllable “U” represents dream consciousness. In dream states, the dreamer and the dreamed are one. Differentiation because of time and space disappear.

The third syllable “M” represents dreamless sleep. In this stage all awareness of the self disappears, and there is complete union with the “Other” as ego and identity are transcended.

The fourth syllable is silent because it is the paradox of voiced silence out of which all things come and into which all things go.

The comprehensive meaning of om cannot be over emphasized. Om represents everything or the wholeness and completeness of all things. Its chanting generates creative and divine energy in all forms of existence and states of mind. Om is the Infinite, the Perfect, the Eternal.

title: Yogic shiva
images: ["hin.yogicshiva.jpg","hin.yogicshiva2.jpg","hin.yogicshivaincense.jpg","hin.yogicshivaincense2.jpg"]
size:
---
As the third member of the Hindu Trimurti (Three Forms), Lord Shiva represents the aspect of Supreme Reality that continuously dissolves and recreates in the cyclic process of the universe. Because Lord Shiva’s action is positive recreation that keeps the universe functioning, dissolver is a more accurate word than the more commonly used destroyer. A common depiction of the Lord Shiva is as a meditating yogi. In this posture of undisturbed meditation he is known as Mahayogi (The Great Teacher). The tops of his feet on his legs with soles facing up and heels nearly touching. Following are some of the symbolism of the yogic Shiva.

Unclad body – Ascetic nature void of possessions and attachments.

White or gray colour – Shiva is thought of as meditation on the cremation grounds. The white/gray ash colour represents cremation ashes symbolic of the transcendence of physical reality.

Matted hair – Because Hindu yogis often wear matted dreadlocked hair, Shiva matted hair indicates his yogi status.

Water from his head – According to legend the waters of live fell upon Shiva’s head becoming the life-giving sacred Ganges River.

Crescent moon – Symbolizes that Shiva transcends the cycles of time.

Third eye on the forehead – The two regular eyes behold the physical world of duality. The right eye is the sun. The left eye is the moon. The third eye is fire. The third eye in the center of the forehead symbolizes spiritual knowledge and power that beholds the world of non-duality and is called the eye of wisdom. The powerful gaze of Shiva's third eye annihilates evil.

Half-open eyes – Indicates a focused, meditative state. At each opening and closing of the eyes universes dissolve and begin.

Two earrings – The left earring (kundala) is a type used by women. The right earring (niranjan) is a type used by men. The earrings not only represent both male and female (Shiva and Shakti power) but also represent transcendence of either human category of opposites.

Snake around the neck – Snakes in Hinduism are symbolic of yogic power. Like an ascetic yogi, a snake eats little, builds nothings, collects nothing, carries no possessions. The coils of the snake represent the cycles of time. The hood of the cobra is raised in a gesture of protection.

Rudraksha mala (red seed necklace) – Rudra is another name for Shiva. More information on the Rudraksha mala is on the site (see Rudraksha Mala).

Abhaya Mudra – If Shiva is shown with more than two arms, one of the right hands is lifted in the abhaya mudra meaning “no fear.”

Trident (Trisula) – The trident or trishula carried by yogis of the Himalayas is the royal sceptre of Lord Shiva. (See “Trident” elsewhere on this site.)

Drum – Either sitting beside Shiva or attached to the trident is an hourglass shaped dhamaru (small drum). The sound produced by a physical instrument and  perceived by the senses represents the formation of the world of physicality and phenomenology.

Water pot – A kamandalu or water pot may be seen on the ground next to Shiva. Sometimes the pot is said to be made from a pumpkin that has been cleaned of dirt and the seeds removed making the shell ready to receive the divine nectar. This is symbolic of an individual eliminating attachments to the manifested realm and stripping away the inner “self” in preparation to receive the bliss of the “Cosmic Self.”

Nandi bull – The word “Nandi” means joy or happiness. Nandi is the cosmic bull upon which Lord Shiva rides. Another name for Nandi is Vrisha meaning righteousness. Thus, Shiva is the companion of righteousness or comes by way of righteousness.

Tiger skin – Shiva is often seen sitting on a tiger skin symbolizing the potential energy of the universe during the dissolution state.

Blow horn – The sound of the horn represents the primordial, archetypal sound which preceded creation.

Bhumisparsha hand – Shiva’s left hand touches the earth

Fruit – When fruit and sweets are presented as offerings to the divine in Hindu puja they are called prasad (grace). The fruit and sweets offered by one devotee may be presented to later devotees as they leave the temple. This represents a cycle of blessings: given-give back-given again.

Shivalinga with om symbol – See entry for Shivalinga elsewhere in the museum.

The small black brass statue of the crawling baby is of Lord Krishna as an infant. Krishna is the eighth major incarnation of Lord Vishnu. At Krishna’s birth the wicked king (Kamsa) slew a number of children because of a prophecy that he would be overthrown by the child Krishna. The baby, however, was smuggled across the river to safety. The child Krishna is legendary for his mischievous pranks. One of the most popular images of the baby Krishna is as the butter thief. In this image Krishna crawls while hold a ball of butter in his right hand. The name Krishna means “The Dark One.” So he is often shown black or blue black. Here he is wearing an elaborate dress necklace, bracelet, and turban. These may be changed regularly as an act of devotion. Under the turban his hair is tied in a traditional topknot.

title: Kamadhenu (wish-fulfilling cow)
images: ["hin.damadhenucow.jpg"]

In Hindu mythology, Kamadhenu is considered the mother of all cows. According to legend, she was owned by either the sage Vasistha or Jamadagni. Scriptures about her say she has the unique power to grant all wishes. Similarly, cows throughout Indian history have provided many basic wishes and necessities of life: milk, butter, ghee for cooking and lamps for home and worship. Even the dung is used for fertilizer, building material and, when dried and burned, for cooking and heating homes. The urine is used for some rituals and is said to have antiseptic qualities. The cow continues to supply needs after her death through her bones and hide. The nature of the cow is benign and undemanding. Thus, the cow has become a living symbol of the divine - gentle yet giving – giving rise to the notion of Sacred Cows. Kamadhenu contains all the gods within her. The image displayed here shows Lord Shiva on her head, Lord Vishnu on her neck, Lord Brahma on the hump, Lord Agni (fire) beside Brahma, Mother Laxmi beneath Brahma, and various other deities and sages across her body. Her eyes are the sun and moon. Her legs are the Four Vedas and the Himalayas. The tip, middle and base of her horns represent the Trimurti.

Displayed is a small hand carved white soapstone image of Shiva and Parvati. Shiva is one of the three main murtis (divine images) of Hinduism. He is the lord of dissolution in the process of continual creation. Parvati is his consort or wife. Of particular note in this image is

the suggestion of a halo behind the murtis’ heads;

Parvati is on Shiva’s left side, the tradition placement of a wife being the side of Shiva’s heart;

The face of the cobra has been damaged at some point in the carving’s history; flowing from Shiva’s head is the waters of the river Ganges; the couple emerge from the leaves of an open lotus, a symbol of spiritual liberation or moksha.
