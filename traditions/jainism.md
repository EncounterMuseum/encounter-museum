title: TIRTHANKARA

In Jainism, a tirthankara is an individual who has attained enlightenment and achieved liberation. The word literally means “ford maker” or “river crosser.” A ford is a shallow part of a river that allows easy passage to the other side. A tirthankara is one who has found the way across ego and escaped the cycle of rebirth, becoming a saviour by example. The image here is of a siddha (liberated soul) who has so overcome ego and the material body that there’s no one there – thus the silhouetted empty space. The image is predominantly seen in shrines of the Digambara sect of Jainism which emphasizes liberation of the soul above all else.

Queen Trishala is the mother of the Indian sage Vardhamana better knows as Mahavira (see cf.), founder of the central tenets of Jainism. According to Jain scripture, Trishala had a series of dreams during her pregnancy foretelling the child’s future. The number of dreams differs in some Jain texts. Displayed here are symbols of fifteen dreams. Beginning with the top row and moving left to right the dreams and interpretations are as follows:

1. White Elephant: The child will guide a spiritual chariot and save human beings from misery, greed, and attachment.

2. White Bull: The child will be a spiritual teacher of monks and kings.

3. Orange Lion: The child will be powerful, strong, fearless, almighty and capable of ruling the world.

4. Goddess Laxmi: The child will attain great spiritual wealth, power and prosperity.

5. Flower Garlands: The fragrance of the child’s teachings will spread over the entire universe.

6. Sun Disc: The child will destroy anger, greed, ego, lust, pride, and all other vices from the lives of people.

7. Moon: The child will have extraordinary charisma and radiate his presence to all living beings.*

8. Flag: The child will be a noble, and well respected leader.

9. Golden Urn: The child will be perfect and virtuous.

10. Lotus Lake: The child will help liberate human beings who are tangled in the cycle of birth, death, and misery.

11. Celestial Plane: All beings in heaven will obey the child, and respect and salute his spiritual teachings.

12. Milky Ocean: The child will navigate through life’s ocean of birth, death and misery toward liberation.

13. Lofty Throne: The child will have a high spiritual status.

14. Heap of Jewels: The child will have infinite virtue and wisdom.

According to Jainism, Bahubali is the second of one hundred sons of Rishabha, the 1st of 24 specially enlightened beings known as Tirthankaras. The 24th Tirthankara was Mahavir, founder of Jainism. In India the 55 foot statue of Bahubali is the largest monolithic statue in the world, visible from 30 km away. Images of Bahubali are shown standing and nude – standing because he attained enlightenment by standing so perfectly still that vines began growing over him – nude because, like many Jain saints, Bahubali renounced all possessions, including the possession of shame. A small lamp may be placed inside the four-side image of Bahubali displayed here allowing light to radiate around him.
