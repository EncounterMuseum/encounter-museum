Jainism is an ancient religion of India espousing radical non-violence and self-control as a means of attaining eternal liberation. The name Jain derives from the Sanskrit jin meaning “to conquer.” Jainism teaches that the anticipated liberation is the effect of conquering one’s passions absolutely. Historians consider Mahavira (540-468 BCE) as the founder although the tradition considers him to be the last of twenty-four spiritual teachers.

In Jainism, a tirthankara is an individual who has attained enlightenment and achieved liberation. The word literally means “ford maker” or “river crosser.” A ford is a shallow part of a river that allows easy passage to the other side. A tirthankara is one who has found the way across ego and escaped the cycle of rebirth, becoming a saviour by example. The image here is of a siddha (liberated soul) who has so overcome ego and the material body that there’s no one there – thus the silhouetted empty space. The image is predominantly seen in shrines of the Digambara sect of Jainism which emphasizes liberation of the soul above all else.

According to Jainism, Bahubali is the second of one hundred sons of Rishabha, the 1st of 24 specially enlightened beings known as Tirthankaras. The 24th Tirthankara was Mahavir, founder of Jainism. In India the 55 foot statue of Bahubali is the largest monolithic statue in the world, visible from 30 km away. Images of Bahubali are shown standing and nude – standing because he attained enlightenment by standing so perfectly still that vines began growing over him – nude because, like many Jain saints, Bahubali renounced all possessions, including the possession of shame. A small lamp may be placed inside the four-side image of Bahubali displayed here allowing light to radiate around him.
