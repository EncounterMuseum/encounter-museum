According to Jewish tradition, the coming of Elijah ushers in redemption and the Messianic Age. Thus, the longing for and welcoming of Elijah is part of many Jewish prayers and rituals. The Elijah’s Cup is part of the seder meal at Passover. A place at the seder table is reserved for Elijah, his cup ready for his coming.

In Hebrew the word mezuzah means doorpost. The object is called mezuzah because it is placed on the doorpost of all entrance/exit doors and most interior doors of homes, offices, hotels, hospitals, etc. Inside the mezuzah is a small parchment with a passage from Deuteronomy 6.4-9 and 11.13-21 handwritten in kosher ink by a qualified scribe. Individuals are to touch the mezuzah when passing through the door. Use of the mezuzah fulfills the law from Deuteronomy 6.9: “And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.”

1. An alcohol bottle with a silver probe used to loosen the foreskin around the glans penis. The bottle has a Star of David on one side and a Hebrew letters cheit and yod ’ה representing God on the other side.

2. A magen (shield) through which the foreskin is passed to protect the glans penis and guide the knife.

3. A mother of pearl handled izamel (knife), typically sharp on both sides.

The shield and knife have the words בְּרִית מִילָה brit milah “ritual circumcision.” This set was made in Austria during the late 1800s. Wear indicates considerable use.

Ner tamid means eternal light. In Judaism it is tradition for a light to burn continuously in front the ark or Aron Kodesh that houses the Torah scroll. The eternal light symbolized the unbroken history of God’s dealings with the Jewish people. From this Jewish tradition comes the Catholic practice of placing a sanctuary lamp in front of the tabernacle, a box or elaborate container for unused consecrated bread of the Eucharist.

Date: Early 1900s

Origin: Bucharest, Romania

A Torah mantel or Mantel of the Law is a specially designed robe to cover and protect the Torah scroll when not in use. Written in Hebrew across the top of this mantel are the words from Isaiah 2.3 “For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem.” Standing on the two pillars are totem lions of the tribe of Judah. The lions hold up the tablets of the Ten Commandments. Above the tablets are the Star of David and a Crown of Glory for the Torah, also representing the crowns the temple high priests. On either side of the crown are letters meaning potential of life. At the bottom of the mantel below the garland of flowers is a dedication to Abraham and Leah Frankel who perished during the Holocaust.

The She’ma, so called because the first word in Hebrew is she’ma שְׁמַע, is the most important phrase in Judaism. The phrase comes from Torah, Deuteronomy 6:4. Note: Hebrew is read right to left.

Hebrew:  שמע ישראל יהוה אלהינו יהוה אחד

Transliteration: Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad

Translation: Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.

A famous declaration of the Hebrew prophet Isaiah regarding a future age of peace states: “They will beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.” (Isaiah 2:4) The same prophecy is repeated in Micah 4:3. Displayed here is a powerful art deco image of Isaiah in front of a plough while lifting a broken sword above his head. The original bronze work by artist Moissaye Marans (1902-1977) is at the New York Community Church.

The menorah is a seven-branched candlestick used in the portable altar established by Moses during the trek of the Hebrews through the desert from Egypt to Canaan (present-day Israel). God’s command to Moses for the design of the menorah may be found in Torah, Exodus 25:31, 32 “And you must make a lampstand of pure gold. Of hammered work the lampstand is to be made. Its base, its branches, its cups, its knobs and its blossoms are to proceed out from it. And six branches are running out from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from its one side and three branches of the lampstand from its other side.” The seven-branched menorah was one of the holy items in the First and Second Jerusalem Temples. Menorah are part of every present-day Jewish house of worship. Seven-branched menorah are often called temple menorah. Nine-branched menorah, used only at the festival of Hanukkah are called hanukiah.

title: rabbi and torah painting
size:
---
This mid 1900 oil on canvas shows an elderly rabbi draped in a traditional white tallit (prayer shawl) with blue stripes carrying the Torah scrolls. The Torah is covered in a red mantel and wears a gold shield or breastplate reminiscent of the breastplate worn by the high priests of the Jerusalem Temple. Reportedly this painting is a practice piece from an art academy in Germany; therefore, it is unsigned and a number of versions apparently exist. This is a particularly fine rendition because of the powerfully tender expression of devotion on the face of the rabbi. The frame is original to the piece. The painting was purchased at a Toronto antique shop in 2003.

title: pomegranate
size:
---
The pomegranate is a fruit native to ancient Persia (Iran). Now, of course, it is grown in many dry warm locations. Because of its bright red colour and abundant seeds, the pomegranate is a rich mythological symbol.

In ancient Persia, the hero Isfandiyar became immortal after eating a pomegranate.

Ancient Egypt considered it a symbol of prosperity.

Ancient Greece considered it “the fruit of the dead” with its many seeds symbolic of ever-renewing life. Persephone, daughter of the high god Zeus and harvest goddess Demeter, ate one pomegranate seed in the underworld giving the world an annual winter.

Pomegranates are a recurring motif in Christian art often with the fruit bursting open symbolic of the death and resurrection of Jesus.

The Islamic Qur’an mentions pomegranates at least three times as an example of good things God created and even caused them to grow in paradise.

In Hinduism pomegranates are associated with Gayati, the earth goddess, and Lord Ganesh who is sometimes called Bijapuraphalasakta or the one fond of the many-seeded fruit.

In China the fruit may be hung in homes to bring prosperity and children.

For Armenians, the many seeds represent the many Armenian people and the many days of the genocide against them.

In the Jewish story, pomegranates are considered one of the fruits the spies brought back to Moses as proof of the bounty of the Promised Land. Because the pomegranate is said hypothetically to have 613 seeds, for Judaism it symbolizes the 613 mitzvot (commandments) in the Torah.

The glass pomegranate box displayed here was purchased at Israel’s Judaica in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. For this reason the object is place in the Jewish gallery.

title: tallit
images: ["jud.tallit.jpg","jud.tallitkatin.jpg"]

The Hebrew tallit or tallis literally means cloak or sheet and refers to what is commonly called a prayer shawl in Judaism. It is worn over the clothes for the weekday morning prayers, Shabbat (Saturday) services, and holidays. One side of the shawl often has a decorative embroidered band called an atarah which means crown. When the tallit is worn the atarah goes over the head since crowns are worn on the head. Some atarah have a prayer of blessing recited when putting on the tallit: “Blessed are You, Lord God, King of the universe, who sanctifies us with Your commandments and commands us to wear the fringe.” The fringe spoken of are the four twisted cords called tzitzit on each corner of the garment. Seeing the tzitzit reminds one of the 613 commandments of the Torah. In ancient times, letters served as numbers as seen in Roman numerals (V=5, X=10, C=100, etc.) The numerical value of the Hebrew letters spelling tzitzit equals 600. The cord has 8 threads and five knots. 600+8+5=613, the number of mitzvot or commandments. A few passages from the Hebrew scripture commanding the design and use of tallit are the following: “The Lord said to Moses: Speak to the Israelites, and tell them to make fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generation and to put a blue cord on the fringe at teach corner. You have the fringe so that, when you see it, you will remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them, and not follow the lust of your own heart and your own eyes. So you shall remember and do all my commandments, and you shall be holy to lour God.” (Numbers 15.37-41) “You shall make tassels on the four corners of the cloak with which you cover yourself.” (Deuteronomy 22.12)

Tallit katan means small prayer shawl in Hebrew. It is a poncho-like garment worn under the shirt by Jewish males, particularly Orthodox Jews. While not nearly as decorative as the regular tallit, it still has the tzitzit (fringe or twisted cord) on the four corners. The purpose of the tzitzit is as a reminder of the 613 commandments. In ancient times, letters served as numbers as seen in Roman numerals (V=5, X=10, C=100, etc.) The numerical value of the Hebrew letters spelling tzitzit equals 600. The cord has 8 threads and five knots. 600+8+5=613, the number of mitzvot or commandments. Although the garment is worn under the shirt, the tzitzit cannot be or they would not be seen. Therefore, the cords are worn over the waist band of the pants in order to be seen as a reminder.

title: tefillin
images: ["jud.tefillin.jpg"]
size:

Tefillin are phylactery cases (small boxes containing scriptures) that contain Torah passages from Deuteronomy 6:4-9 and 11:18. The scripture commands binding of the words to the hand and between the eyes. What is known as “laying tefillin” fulfills this commandment. The word is derived from the word “tefilah” to pray. One tefillah case has long straps for wrapping around the arm, hand and fingers. The other case has a circular strap for the head, placing the case on the forehead between the eyes. Tefillah are worn for the morning prayer and removed at the conclusion of the service. Inside the cases are the Deuteronomy passages written on parchment with kosher ink by a qualified scribe. The side of each case has the Hebrew letter shin (v). A few passages from the Hebrew scripture commanding the design and use of tefillin as well as the scripture passages inside are the following: “The Lord said to Moses: You shall tell your child, It is because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt. It shall serve for you as a sign on your hand and as a reminder on your forehead, so that the teaching of the Lord may be on your lips; for with a strong hand the Lord brought you out of Egypt.” (Exodus 13.1, 8, 9) “Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. Keep these words that I am commanding you today in your heart. Recite them to your children and talk about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise. Bind them as a sign on your hand, fix them as an emblem on your forehand, and write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” (Deuteronomy 6.4-9) “You shall put these words of mine in your heart and soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on you hand, and fix them as an emblem on your forehead. Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, so that your days and the days of your children my be multiplied in the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth.” (Deuteronomy 11.18)
