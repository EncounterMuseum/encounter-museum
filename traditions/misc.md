Unlike a maze, a labyrinth is a unicursal (one path) design that can be followed unfailingly from the entrance to the centre and out again. Labyrinths are ancient patterns found in most every culture. Two of the most popular labyrinths are the more ancient version known as the Seven Circuit and the labyrinth set in the floor of the Chartres cathedral in France in the 1200s. Shown here are the Chartres style, Seven Circuit and Square design.

title: Follow Your Bliss
images: ["mis.followyourbliss.jpg"]
size:
---
One of the most well known quotations of Joseph Campbell is the three-word phrase: “Follow your bliss.” Campbell formulated the concept from the Upanishads (a Hindu scripture) that describes the highest level of experience as “ananda” or bliss. The context of the passage from “Sacrifice and Bliss, “The Power of Myth is as follows: “Follow your bliss where the deep sense of being is from where your body and soul want to go. When you have that feeling, then stay with it and don’t let anyone throw you off. If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life you ought to be living is the one you are living. When you see that, you begin to meet people who are in the field of your bliss, and they open doors to you. I say follow your bliss and doors will open where there were no doors before. Follow your bliss and don’t be afraid, and doors will open where you would not have thought there would be doors and where there wouldn’t be a door for anyone else.”

title: Hand of Blessing (Auguste Rodin)
images: ["mis.rodinhand.jpg","mis.rodinhand2.jpg"]
size:
---
The French sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) is perhaps best known for his sculpture The Thinker. Rodin considered human hands as expressive as the human face and created a series of bronze cast sculpture studies of the hand. Because of its pose, “The Right Hand of Pierre Wissant” is sometimes called “The Hand of Blessing.” The position of the hand is in the traditional Christian symbol of blessing by a priest: thumb, index finger and third finger are raised representing the Trinity; the small and ring fingers down representing the two nature of Christ (human and divine). The reproduction displayed was purchased at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, in 2004.

title: Divination Dowsing pendulum
images: ["mis.pendulum.jpg","mis.pendulum2.jpg"]
size:

A crystal or metal fob suspended as a pendulum on a chain or cord is sometimes used for divination and dowsing. The user arbitrarily  determines which direction (left-right, up-down) will indicate "yes" and which "no" before proceeding to ask the pendulum specific yes/no questions. The pendulum may also be held over a paper with "yes" and "no" or other words written on it in a circle. The person holding the pendulum holds it as steadily as possible over the center and the pendulum’s movements is believed to indicate answers.

title: Creation Mandala
images: ["mis.creationmandala.jpg"]
size:

The Creation Mandala was crafted by the Subanen native women of the Mindanao Island in the Philippines. With the modest income from their crafts the women are helped to provide food, basic education, and minimal health care for their families. In eight connected circles, the mandala honours the unfolding story of the universe. Appropriately, the women refer to the story as a series of “births.” Starting at the bottom of the mandala and moving clockwise, the eight births are

The Birth of the Universe – yellow burst of energy

The Birth of the Galaxies – blue spiral

The Birth of the Solar System – circling planets

The Birth of the Earth – formation around a star

The Birth of Life – tree of life

The Birth of the Earth Community – diversity of rainbow DNA

The Birth of Humans – human figures

The Birth of the Ecological Age – interconnected web at the centre

title: Chinese Lion Phallic talisman
images: ["mis.chineselionfertilitytalisman.jpg","mis.chineselionfertilitytalisman2.jpg"]
size:
---
Displayed is an unusual Chinese phallic talisman. The primary form is a Chinese Guardian Lion known as a Shishi. The posture of the lion is a begging posture, much like a small pet dog may do. However, a double entendre of the piece is its resemblance to a phallus. From the back the resemblance is obvious. From the front, the resemblance is still rather evident, and the bent knees of the lion form suggestions of the phallic symbol’s testicles. The word talisman derives from the Greek term for “to be initiated into the mysteries.” Therefore, talismans are used as magical objects of mysterious energy. They may be small items worn as amulets around the neck, carried in pockets, etc. Talismans may also be larger items such as the one here and placed in vital locations within a space to bring about a hoped for end or to prevent an unwanted one. Phallic talismans are often for protection or virility. The Chinese writing on the back of the talisman loosely translate as “Big Men Brag.”

title: Genghis Khan yurt picture
images: ["mis.genghiskhanpicture.jpg"]
size:
---
Born in Mongolia, Genghis Khan’s (1162-1227) actual name was Temujin. He became known as Genghis Khan (Great Emperor) after he united various nomadic tribes of northeast Asia forming the vast Mongol Empire, the largest contiguous empire in history. His religion is speculated to have been shamanism or a type of indigenous spirituality among the nomadic tribes of Central Asia. However, he seems to have been amazingly tolerant religiously and interested in learning philosophy and moral teachings from other religions. Reportedly Genghis Khan consulted with Buddhist and Daoist monks, Muslims, and Christian missionaries. Displayed here is a hand painted picture on wood of Genghis Khan seated in a yurt (tent) receiving various visitors and dignitaries from throughout the empire bringing gifts and bowing respectfully. Two attendants stand behind him. One attendant holds a chauri or whisk over Genghis Khan’s head as a sign of respect.

title: Frankincense and Myrrh
images: ["mis.frankincenseandmyrrh.jpg"]
size:
---
Frankincense and myrrh are types of incense. Both are from the fragrant gum or sap of specific trees that grow in arid areas of the Mid-East – boswellia for frankincense and commiphora for myrrh. Frankincense is a milky, pale gum, and myrrh is darker and reddish brown. The gum is collected by cutting small slits in the bark of the trees from which the sap slowly seeps. When the small drops of sap (called tears) harden, they are gathered from the trees. Many religions use frankincense and myrrh including Christianity (particularly Orthodox), ancient Egyptian religions, Islam, Judaism, Neo-Paganism, and Zoroastrianism. A well-known Christian story from Matthew 2:11 tells how wise men from the east brought gold, frankincense and myrrh as gifts to the baby Jesus: “On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.” (NRSV) These men are generally considered to have been Zoroastrian priests called maga, magi plural (considered wise students of astronomy). Fire in Zoroastrianism, though not worshiped, is a symbol of Ahura Mazda, the Wise Lord. By colour, gold is a logical and portable material representative of fire. Frankincense and myrrh are still used today in Zoroastrian worship and placed as an offering into the sacred fire. Therefore, gold, frankincense and myrrh were logical gifts for the magi to bring.
