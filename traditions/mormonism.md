title: HILL BRICK
size:
---
Rare “Hill Brick” from Nauvoo, Illinois, USA, with the name of the brick maker, Isaac Hill (“I HILL”) on the front of the brick. Few Hill Bricks were marked with the name and rarely is one found that can be read. Hill Bricks are known for their concave shape saving the brick maker material and also requiring more mortar…which Mr. Hill also sold. The Hill Brickyard was the smallest brickyard in Nauvoo during the Mormon period, and few buildings used Hill Bricks. This brick is from the fireplace of Hiram and Phoebe Clack whose backyard joined the backyards of Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jr. The brick still shows the soot of the fireplace’s last fire January 1846 before the Clarks followed Brigham Young west.

Date: 1840

Origin: Nauvoo, Illinois

Palmyra Grove, known by Mormons as The Sacred Grove, is a wooded area across the road from the boyhood home of Joseph Smith, Jr., in Palmyra, New York, USA. In that wooded area Joseph Smith, Jr., prophet and founder of the Latter-day Saint movement, reported receiving what is called The First Vision in which he conversed with God the Father and Jesus Christ. This stone is from the supposed location of that vision within Palmyra’s grove.

Kirtland Temple is a United States National Historic Landmark in Kirtland, Ohio, just east of Cleveland. The building was the first Latter-day Saint Temple constructed 1833-1836. Smith reported that in the Kirtland Temple he received visions of God the Father, Jesus Christ, Adam, Abraham, Moses, Elias, Elijah, Apostle Peter, and numerous angels. Brigham Young was reported to have been inspired to speak in tongues during the dedication of the Temple March 27, 1836. Today the building is owned by the Community of Christ. Displayed here is the northeast corner of the original sandstone front step of the 1830s Temple.
