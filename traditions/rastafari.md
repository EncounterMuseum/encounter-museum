The African slave trade and the period of slavery, particularly in the United States, are important elements of the Rastafarian story. Because Rasta sees itself as the continuation of the true Hebrew lineage in the world, being taken into slavery is akin to the period of Hebrew slavery in Egypt and Babylon. Sadly, these shackles were fashioned to fit the small ankles of a child.

Date: Antebellum (pre-Civil War)

Origin: Southern United States

Sometimes called The Blackman’s Bible, The Holy Piby, first published in 1924, is the recorded revelation of Robert Athlyi Rogers from his visions with the Angel Douglas in Woodbridge, New Jersey. The revelation details the restoration of apostles, prophets and other former structures of Bible times and, although a name is not mentioned, foretells the coronation of His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Haile Selassie in 1930: “For unto Ethiopia this day a Shepherd is anointed, yea, as a shepherd gathers his sheep so shall he gather unto God the generations of Ethiopia even from the end of the earth and lead them high, a nation among nations.”

The Kebra Negast or The Glory of the Kings is a major scripture of the Rastafarian religion. It outlines the meeting and relationship of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba resulting in the birth of their son, Menelek, and the establishment of the Solomonic dynasty of rulers in Ethiopia ending with the deposing of His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Haile Selassie on September, 12, 1974. The longer title of the book is The Queen of Sheba and Her Only Son Menyelek Being the History of the Departure of God and His Ark of the Covenant from Jerusalem to Ethiopia, and the Establishment of the Religion of the Hebrews and the Solomonic Line of Kings in that Country. The book began first as an oral tradition, then anciently written in Coptic, then translated into Arabic in 1225, with the first English translations in 1922 and 1932
