Daikokuten and Ebisu are often paired as the household kami (gods/spirits) of good fortune. They are sometimes found in Buddhist temples, particularly in Tibet. Wearing a broad hat and plain cloak of a workman, Daikokuten holds a hammer called uchide no kozuchi or magic money mallet in his right hand, a bag of treasure in his left hand and stands on bundles of harvested rice. Together the hammer and rice symbolize prosperity through hard work. The triple rings on the head of the hammer symbolizes prosperity and fertility. Images of Daikokuten are often placed in kitchens of homes and monasteries to assure plenty. Origins of Daikokuten can be traced to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva. The second figure named Ebisu wears a soft hat and formal kimono of an aristocrat. Ebisu is the child of the Japanese primordial sea gods Izanagi and Izanami. Reminiscent of the Moses story, as an infant Ebisu was placed in a reed basket in the sea, washed ashore and was raised by a foster family, the Ainu, ancient people of Japan. Ebisu holds a fish under his left arm, symbolic of the bountiful gifts of nature and the sea.

title: Temple roof tile

These decorative Japanese clay roof ridge terminal decorations, called "onigawara” or ridge end tiles, are from the early 1940s and once mounted the end of a tile ridge cap atop of the roof of an old Japanese house. “Onigawara” literally means “demon tiles” because some early end tiles were traditionally molded in the shape of a demon’s head or face, much like the function of a gargoyle to ward off evil. The onigawara displayed here is a swirling cloud or wave pattern. Onigawara developed around the middle of the Edo period when the tile roofs became popular for houses and reflected the status of the home owner. This one came from a pre-World War II old traditional style Japanese house damaged in an earthquake years ago in Sawara, Japan, along the Tone River north west of Tokyo. The back lower right edge of the tile shows a small chip from earthquake damage. The firing process gave the tile its silvery finish. The ring in the back cavity of the tile is a connection point to the roof’s ridge line.

Origin: Sawara, Japan

Date: early 1940s, pre World War II
