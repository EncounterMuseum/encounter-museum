The Guru Granth Sahib or Adi Granth is the sacred book of the Sikhs. It is a collection of 1,430 hymns of the ten Sikh Gurus or spiritual teachers compiled 1469-1708. As testimony of Sikhism inclusive view of religion, the book also contains writing of Hindu and Muslim saints. Today the book is considered the living Guru of Sikhism in book form and treated as a human being having its own bed in every Sikh temple. Although the original language of the Granth is Gurmukhi (a particular script of Punjabi), the version shown here is an English translation. Unlike the Torah scrolls that are handwritten by a scribe, copies of the Granth are machine printed.

The Khanda is the general symbol of Sikhism. It is made up of three swords and a circle. The two outer swords are Miri (temporal/political power) and Piri (spiritual power). The handles of the swords intersect suggesting that these two powers are not separate parts of our lives but rather intersect. The chakra or circle represents the eternal nature of God. The double-edged sword in the centre is the One God of Sikhism. The central sword is symbolically sharp on both sides as the word of God separates truth from error. As with all rich symbols, other meanings may assigned to the emblem.
