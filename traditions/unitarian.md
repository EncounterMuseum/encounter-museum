Unitarianism was present in the early days of Christianity as theological opposition to the notion of Trinitarianism (God in three persons). Today Unitarianism identifies less as Christian and more as an individual, liberal, spiritual journey expressed through social action and a responsible search for truth and meaning wherever it may be found.

The symbol of Unitarianism is a flame within a chalice representing the flame of the intellect/spirit within the chalice of life. This small chalice was a gift to Encounter at the 2005 Unitarian National Conference in Hamilton, Ontario.
