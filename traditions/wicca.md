A broad expression of Paganism, Wicca is a modern-day representation of European pre-Christian spirituality. After many centuries of suppression, Paganism/Wicca re-emerged into public awareness in the 1950s. Wicca is a nature religion seeking balance and harmony with all creation as expressed in the seasons and phases of the moon. The understanding of divinity may be either literal or metaphoric and includes both Gods and Goddesses with the Goddess taking primacy.

A Book of Shadows is a quasi-scripture text of the Wicca tradition. It may include religious stories, chants, poems, instructions, spells, incantations, etc. for personal use or the performance of rituals. Although fully written Book of Shadows are available, a more authentic Book of Shadows, as the one shown here, has blank pages in which owner writes entries of particular individual significance. More authentic yet is a book the person has created…making the paper, stitching the binding, etc.

Neo-Paganism and Wicca use a number of ritual tools which may include a short staff sometimes vernacularly called a “magic” wand. Wands are tools of gentle invitation or direction of a particular energy or intent. Traditionally wands are made from oak or hazel wood. The wand displayed here is a caduceus style of two intertwined snakes.

Hecate originally derived from the Egyptian midwife Goddess Hekat. In Greece, Hecate was one of the many names for the original feminine trinity ruling Heaven, Earth and the Underworld. Greeks tend to emphasize her crone or underworld aspect. Hecate was called "Most lovely one", a title of the moon. She was associated with the moon in all three of her aspects. Some said she was Hecate Selene, the Moon in Heaven; Artemis the Huntress on Earth and Persephone the Destroyer in the Underworld. Sometimes she was part of the Queen of Heaven Trinity; Hebe the Virgin, Hera the Mother and Hecate the Crone.

The original is 17 inches tall and was found in the entrance to a cave that was both a dwelling place and a ceremonial site. She was painted red, the color of life, blood, and rebirth. Paleolithic sculptors chiselled her out of limestone with tools of flint, and gave her to hold in her right had a bison's horn, crescent-shaped like the moon, which is notched with thirteen marks representing the thirteen days of the waxing moon and the thirteen months of the lunar year. With her left hand she points to her swelling womb. Her head is tilted towards the crescent moon, drawing a curve of relationship from her fingers on the womb up through the incline of her head to the crescent horn in her hand, so creating a connection between the waxing phase of the moon and the fecundity of the human womb.
