The small piece of wood inside is sandalwood from India used as an burnt offering to the sacred fire. This shrine picture was a gift in the late 1980s from the fire keeper and temple custodian of the Mehraban Guiv Darbe Mehr Zoroastrian Temple, Toronto.

The emblem of Zoroastrian faith depicts a “Fravashi” – the Divine Essence. It is a guiding, protecting spirit that remains with a person throughout life. The symbol represents two worlds. The Physical world is represented by the image of man, and the Spiritual world is represented by the wings and the tail. The circle in the center represents that the soul is immortal having neither beginning nor end. The five layers in each wing represent the five Gathas (The Divine Songs) of Zarathushtra, as well as the five senses of the human body. The two curved leg symbols on either side of the circle represent the recognition of the existential duality between Good and Evil. Good is toward the face indicating a procession to the Good. Evil is the back indicating a reject of the bad. The tail serves as a symbolic rudder to help the soul balance between the two forces of Good and Evil, guiding the soul along the Righteous Path. The three layers of feathers on the tail symbolize the central core of Zoroastrianism, “Good Thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds.” One of the two hands points upward in the direction to the right path. he other hand holds a ring, symbolizing Perfection. The two plates have Avestan (associated with Old Persian) writing of the triple motto of Zoroastrianism read right to left: Humata – Good Thoughts; Hukhta – Good Works, Huvarshta – Good Deeds.
